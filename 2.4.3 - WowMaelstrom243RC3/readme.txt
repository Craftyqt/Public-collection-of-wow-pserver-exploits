WowMaelstrom 2.4.3   [Release Candidate 3]  (rubber duckie)
www.wopstick.co.uk

_____Legal Stuff, Warnings, and Rambling:

	This proggie comes with no warranty either expressed or
	implied. Basically if it fucks up your computer, spills ur coffee
	rapes ur goldfish and raises the dead, it's all *your* fault!
	
	Free to distribute as long as you dont modify, etc, and this readme
	remains, intact. 
	You *may* distribute with a small link to the download site,
	but bundle any other shit with that, and I'll hunt you down.

	For the love of god, use it on a private server, this program
	makes no attempt to hide itsself from WoW/Warden, so while
	it will work on live 2.4.3, you'll get caught eventually.

	This license is subject to change at any point without prior notice.

	Wallclimb2: Full on vertical climbing
	No Fall Dmg: See title
	Tele To Plane: WEH Style, teleports you to a plane slightly below 
		the ground where players/mobs cant see you.
	Scale: Basically useless, but fun.
	Faction: Use to attack stuff/see levels.
	Speeeed!: Speeds whole game up.
	Gravity: Jump higher, fall slower.

Movement Type:

	Levitate: Hover slightly, walk on water, no fall dmg.
	Fly: You Fly (swim) in the air. Hoot.
	Walk on Water: Basically putting jesus to shame.
	Slow Fall: Like the potion, but without the fuss.

Speed Settings:
	Enter values in the boxes Forwards,Back,Swim & Fly.
	x1: sets to default
	x2/x10//2: Multiplies/divides by given ammount.
	Lock: Constantly writes the values, handy if you get stunned, slowed, etc.

Current Loc/ Warpage:
	Current Loc: Shows current location and rotation.
	'>' Button: Copies to the warp section...
	Go: Warps to the specified coordinates...
	Bmk: Save/Load a warp with filename of your choice, for sharing, 
	and storing,

Up/Down/Nudge:
	/\ & \/: Warps/Nudges you up a bit...
	Nudge: Warps you just a little at a time to avoid cheat detection.
	Blink: Warps you in the direction you face. Use slider to set distance.
		You can use the (`) key for this also, (next to 1, above tab)

Keybindings:
	New hook .dll to read keystrokes flawlessly. Any key can be assigned to
	any function. Yay. Some only available thru keystrokes!
	(i.e. quickwarps 1 - 9)
		
Debug Window:
	Don't really have to worry 'bout this unless something isn't writing
	for whatever reason. (cross ur fingers)

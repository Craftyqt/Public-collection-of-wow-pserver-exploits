  // ===[ Overview & Usage ]=== //

sn0wball is an easy-to-use multi-hack for World of Warcraft v1.12.1 Vanilla.
This hack is not designed for live/retail servers. It was created solely for
private server use (such as Elysium, Light's Hope, Kronos, or Nostalrius).

Using sn0wball is fairly easy; there is no login or licensing system. Simply
open the application, and it will attempt to find a running client. If no
client can be found, you may refresh the list after you open World of Warcraft. 



  // ===[ Hotkeys ]=== //

Commands are self-explanitory, and every function can be bound to a hotkey.
Check the "Configure Hotkeys" button for more information. PLEASE NOTE:
Functions may not be bound to the same hotkey.



  // ===[ Locations ]=== //

A list of saved teleport locations can also be accessed via the "Saved
Locations" button. Double-clicking an entry will push the location data
to the main form, to allow you to teleport. You may also save your current
location to the list by clicking the "Add Current Location" button.

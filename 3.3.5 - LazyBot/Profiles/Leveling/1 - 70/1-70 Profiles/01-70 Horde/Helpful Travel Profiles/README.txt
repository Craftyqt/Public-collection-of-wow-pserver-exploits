Notice that the Bloodvenom Post to Everlook has the (NOT AFK) tag - this means exactly what it says.
Stay with the glider and help guide it. You will be walking through a tunnel FILLED with mobs. Be careful. Once you get it through the tunnel, go ahead and start the glide again.


Another thing - Profiles involving 'The Great Lift' - Glider will stop before the lift from xroads. This is where you need to go ahead and get on the lift for glider. Once your toon has gone all the way down the lift, start up the next profile which takes you to freewind post (unless for some odd reason you just wanted to go to the great lift)
Enjoy!

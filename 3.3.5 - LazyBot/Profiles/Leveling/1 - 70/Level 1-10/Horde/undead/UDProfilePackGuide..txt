Well these are my first published profiles. 

Summary - Overall
These glides were tested on a new server.
Tested with a priest at lvls listed on glide.
I used these glides to get me from 2-12 and make some good cash for those lvls.
See summary for pull distance.
Factions are used/included.
Professions: Tailoring (Permanent)
	     Herbalism (temporary)
The reason for using tailoring in this glide is that by turning the linnen you get into
bolts of linnen cloth you get 4s out of a stack of linnen rather than 2.36s which means
more money which is a good thing.

Glide summaries:

1. Spiders2-4
location- Night web hollow which is NW of Deathknell
Drops- crap drops for lowbie cash, rare chance of bag drop.
Info- 1 quest here from one of the guys in deathknell. 
runs outside of cave in circle, yes it will pick up some nightweb spiders even
though the majority of those are in the cave. Could be run at level 1 but might get a little
hairy with the lvl 4 nightwebs. Feel free to run afk but be warned their are other players 
that are going to be there.
Pull Distance: 30yds although it doesnt really matter on this one.

2. Scarletlvl4-6
Location- The scarlet camp east of Deathknell
Drops- some weapons for cash and some copper.
Info- 1 quest here gets you a better weapon. Runs a loop outside of the cluster of tents, 
but avoids the tents because of posibility of a 3 mob pull. Could possibly run to 7 but that 
would be pointless because the next glide is much better.Feel free to run afk but be warned 
their are other players that are going to be there.
Pull Distance: 25yds, 30 aggroes the camp and 20 misses a bunch of mobs.

3. SmallCorps6-7
Location- Cold Hearth Manor or the area east of the bridge going to brill.
Drops- a couple of greens,bags. Lots of linnen I would filter crap with lootfilter on this one.
Info- One quest for some cash. this glide loops the inside of the fence and pulls a couple 
of mobs outside of it. I wouldnt afk this one since it takes about 20 min then you can move
on.
Pull Distance 30 although 25 would be fine for you charging warriors. :)

4. Corpseextended7-10
Location- Cold Hearth Manor or the area east of the bridge going to brill.
Drops- a couple of greens,bags. Lots of linnen I would filter crap with lootfilter on this one.
Info- One quest for some cash. this glide loops the inside of the fence and area outside of it.
I had 3 6-slot bags drop 2 greens and 180 linnen cloth as well as lvled from 8-12 overnight.
The reason that this is lvl 7-10 is that there is a lvl 8 vamp duskbat that sometimes aggros
on top of your pull that a lvl 6 sometimes cant take. Also there is more mobs so that you 
dont need to worry about respawns. Feel free to afk this one, I did.
Pull Distance 30 although 25 would be fine for you charging warriors. :)

I hope this helps you folks as much as it did me. I fell in love with it, realized i had
made it and slapped my self for being narcisistic. (however you spell that word)

This is basic for Melee but can work for casters to!
This is the group of profiles that i have made my self and some i have found on forum,but those i found moste effective
for leveing and Gold makeing for mount/gear at the same time
and ofc the profiles i had minimum deaths

easy to set up

Reason i have so many 1-10 profiles is the many differences betwin classes in the start some have som hard mobs but gives
max xp and some got easy mobs but the xp drops a little...but in this level it should not have so much to say

42-47 profile have a rare pet drop that can be sold for 200g - 1000g deppends on the server^^,

62 - 65 drops rep items(Sporregar and Senerion) and primal life for the gold+rares/greens

65 - 70 drops a lot of cloth, Silver and Mots of shadow that can be sold for a lot of gold inc it can drop world drops epic
and ofc blue/green

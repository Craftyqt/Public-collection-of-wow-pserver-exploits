Paperboi's 1-70 Paladin Glider Pack
-------------------------------------

I'd like to thank all those who have tested the pre-release that I posted months ago, and who gave me comments and ways to improve my profiles,

all those who posted on the thread, I thank you.


And, as one of my biggest influences in glideing, Thank you STANDER!

his profiles are much better than some of mine, and I urge you to try them out...

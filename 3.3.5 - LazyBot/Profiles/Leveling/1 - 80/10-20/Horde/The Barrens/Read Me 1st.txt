 -->>Team OMW you Rock<<--
Greets to Everyone on the forum you make this place such a great place to hang around  

PUJ= pick up junk

Here go`s

Start with  Valley of Trials till you hit 5 my reccomendation would be to dump and non stacking items from your 1 measaly bag once you have the set of armour your class uses
As stated on the forum for caster classes use warrior till bout 4 so you have a range of spells that you can use to grind with .
1 Full 16 slot bag worth at this point bout 3 silver 

Then move on to Durotaur Start 6-8 till you hit bout 8 ish same again dumping non stacking items at this point i would go to OG and take up cooking and tailoring and skinning then run back cook the meat from the boars free food skin everything in sight free money tailoring comes next. 
full bag worth bout 5-7 silver

Kolkar crag 6-8 is next stop dump everything but Linen and make Bags when these are full you should be level 9 you can also do "thwarting Kolkar Aggression" from the guy just outside of  seijinn Village if you set puj on with a range of 30 ish. 
Not my profile so credit to who made that one 

Next is Razorwind canyon most of the stackables here are worth a bit more than the previous glides stay here till 12 you can complete the "missing surplies" (think that is what its called) quest with Puj on to 20.
bags now worth 25ish silver depending on drops AH the linnen and leather you get and grab someone with leather working to make you scraps into light leather. (or jus filter em as there will be plenty more) 

Onto Crossroads Circle From 12 to 15 run this at night so less traffic i have never had a problem jus use a badly spelt /dnd message and you will be fine like /dnd plese jus grinding for speed xp not company thanx you can complete 3 quests for xtra Xp and cash two from the female orc ( 1 and 2 in a quest chain) in the center next to the main entrance (cant miss her) and also the raptors one from the guy next to the Inn. 

Then at 15 go to savannah i love this profile i have ran it for 5 chrs now and only once have i seen 1 other person loads of lvl 6-12 greens drop here too filter everything apart from the furry paws as these are the best sellers you can also do quest number 3 from the female orc mentioned earlier stay here till 21 (yeah really) purely to build up some cash from the green drops.

At 21 move to Stonetalon mountains this is another great profile again filter everything except the large hoof got 3 blue drops here and loads of greens. 

At 26 go to Hillsbrad west of tarren mill with this profile you can complete 1 quest and semi complete another both from the undead guy in the room next to the bat handler 
loads of meat for people who cook and some good greens kinda busy at peak times however so another late/early run. 

At 28 head up to ashenvale Night run is great secluded with good drops filter the pages the shredder manual or you bags will fill with cheap crap and you dont want that, wool and silk drop here too.

At 30 go to felfire hill ashenvale again, Poor drops, mostly greys some greens drop here but not enough for my liking :)

At 32 head off to shimmering flats 30-32 run this till about 35 filter out the meat if your not into cooking but keep on skinning if you dont have nearly enough money for your mount by now your doing something wrong 

Then after 35 go to shimmering flats 2 its a larger profile that spans the whole of that area set hearth to Gad to save time running  at the start of your run same filters marinally better drops 

(Thanks team OMW) i used this profile to hit 40 from 38 duskwallow marsh turtles filter the scaley tails but keep the shell fragments ££££ 

If you need anything past these get Team OMW`s pack its great 

Well i didnt do it all by myself so grats to those people who`s profiles I ripped off :) i love ya 

NMLA`s Top tips: GET A MULE and mail all the leather and drops you get to him but don`t grind for a week forgetting to clear his stuff or you will be at the mailbox for 2 hours unloading 2015 medium leather from the mail system (i was heh) get enchanting for him and my rule of thumb is if it dont sell twice then Disenchant it and sell the bits 

Cooking is your friend, fish and cook you way to 300 and you will never need to buy food for any following chrs SAVING YOU MONEY see my guide in general if you need help  

Get loot filter its a botters best mate I also use allinone inventory and auto decline plus CT mass mail 

If i have forgot anything remind me and ill add it 
Appologies for bag grammar its sunday morning and i went out last night and got very drunk:)

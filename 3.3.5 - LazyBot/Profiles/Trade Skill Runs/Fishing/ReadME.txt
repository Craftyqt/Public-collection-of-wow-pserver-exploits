Set Up
Load profile, stand facing water, put pole in hand, apply lure and go fishing.

Bar 6 (rest bar)
Slot 9: Lure
Slot -: Fishing Skill

Avoid Detection
Follower Detection - Unlike patrolling, you don’t casually pass by other players. You just stand in one spot. If other players happen to fish in your area, chances are higher that they will want to chat it up with you than if they were concentrating on intensely battling mobs. Set your followers detection to log out after a minute or two.

Unbind Jump - The tell tale jump while fishing is a give away that you are gliding. You need to disable it so you will look like any other player out fishing for the day. Here’s how:

If haven’t already made a glider keys.xml file, make one. Go to Launchpad or Glider’s ‘Configuration’, choose ‘Keys’ tab and under ‘Key Mapping’ choose ‘Save’. Now you have a keys.xml file in the Glider folder. Open that file with an XML editor (notepad) and change the jump bind to this:
&lt;Key KeyName="Common.Jump" BarState="Indifferent" ShiftState="None" Char="Undefined" /&gt;

-=Step By Step Start Instructions=-
For Glider default key settings, otherwise adjust accordingly.
1. Load profile.
2. If you are playing a pet class, summon or call it.
3. In WoW, open ‘spellbook & abilities’ (P), go to General Tab and drag your fishing skill (not your fishing pole) to rest bar slot – (dash, second from right).
4. Put your fishing lure (if you have one) in rest bar slot 9. You might have to move your Band-Aids or a spell.
5. Face or stand in fishable water giving your self clearance to cast in front of you.
6. Zoom camera in for best view of water, your toon should be 1/4th as tall as the whole game window.
7. Adjust camera angle so the horizon about 25% from top of your screen.
8. Start Glider.

From Glider Manual

Fishing
If you want Glider to fish for you, create a profile and set this option. When you push the Glide button, it will begin fishing. A fishing profile does not currently need waypoints, but support may be added in future versions to allow it to move around on the beach/dock/etc and appear more human.

The fishing skill should be set in the - (dash, second from right) slot on your rest bar (Shift+6 by default). Simply drag the fishing icon from the first page in your spellbook onto that slot.

Note: when fishing, camera position and zoom is important. Your character should be about 1/4th as tall as the whole game window. Try to angle the camera down so that the bobber appears near the top of the window, but not so far that it's out of sight or against the very top.

Auto-lure
To have Glider automatically apply lure to your fishing pole during fishing, set the number of minutes here. Glider will assume you have already set fresh lure when you begin the fishing process. Otherwise, lure will be re-applied as long as you fish and still have some. The shortcut to lure items should be in the 9 slot on your rest bar. Be sure to set the timer high enough for the lure to expire, otherwise the game may pause Glider with a popup confirmation on replacing the existing lure.]

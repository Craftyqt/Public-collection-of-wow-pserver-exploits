This is intended for those new to glider and also the specific profile pack contained can be used by anyone, This is just a started point for many users, If you think the guide is missing something the please drop a post in a friendly manner and i will try my best to add it to the guide.\line\line Thank You For Your Time\cf0\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b The Mage\b0\line\line Mages are ranged magic damage dealers with very powerful direct and area effect damage spells, but weak armor and health. They also feature a variety of utility spells, including crowd control, teleportation and group portals to capital cities, and conjuration of food and water. Mages are reliant on mana for almost all of their abilities.\line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Available to: \cf0 Blood Elves, Gnomes, Humans, Troll, Undead, Draenei\line\bullet  \cf2 Type: \cf0 Massive Magic Damage Dealer\line\bullet  \cf2 Standard Bars: \cf0 Health/Mana\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Armor: \cf0 Cloth\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Weapons: \cf0 Daggers, Wands, Swords, Staves\line\bullet  \cf2 Comments: \cf0 Excellent Damage Class, Can Create Own Food + Water\line\bullet  \cf2 Main Stats: \cf0 Intellect and Stamina\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Magic Schools\b0\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Fire\cf0  spells are primarily damage-dealing spells, including direct single-target damage and area of effect (AoE) damage. With Fire comes other side-effects such as damage over time, and for fire-specializing mages, stun, disorient and daze effects. Fire spells typically have a higher damage output potential than Frost or Arcane spells, and accordingly higher threat. Fire's stun, disorient and daze effects also typically have both a lower proc rate and duration than Frost's snare as well, in order to balance the higher damage. \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Frost\cf0  spells are primarily single-target and area of effect damage-dealing spells, but with more emphasis on chilling effects. Nearly every frost spell has a chill or freeze effect that fully or partially immobilizes an enemy. This includes freezing it in place (called a root) or slowing its movement speed (called a snare). Frost specialized mages can further improve these chilling effects and increase frost damage output to respectable levels. Frost spells help the mage use kiting as a combat tactic. \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Arcane\cf0  spells are primarily utility spells, though there are several useful direct-damage arcane spells, including the very useful area of effect spell Arcane Explosion. Arcane spells allow the mage to remove curses, provide crowd control, absorb damage, teleport himself or others to major capital cities, Slow Fall, Counterspell, buff players' intellect stat, save mana for later use in the form of mana gems, conjure food and water for himself or others, and perform many other useful roles that give the mage class its perks. \line\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Races\b0\line\line\cf2 Draenei\cf0\line\line\bullet  Gift of the Naaru - Activate to heal your target for 35 + 15 per Level over 15 sec - 40 yd range - 1.5 sec cast - 3 min cooldown. (At level 1 it heals 50 health, and 1085 at level 70) \line\bullet  Inspiring Presence - Increases chance to hit with spells by 1% for you and all party members within 30 yards.\line\bullet  Gemcutting - 5 point skill bonus to Jewelcrafting\line\bullet  Shadow Resistance - Increase Shadow Resistance by 10.\line\line Gift of the Naaru is the main one here, it really can help the solo mage grind up, also Inspiring Presence is nice to have, all od the Draeneis racials are pretty good for a mage.\line\line\cf2 Human \cf0\line\line\bullet  Perception - Activate to increase stealth detection radius by 10 yards - lasts 20 sec \endash  3 min cooldown \line\bullet  The Human Spirit - passive Increase Spirit by 10% \line\bullet  Diplomacy - Passive 10% bonus to faction point gain \line\bullet  Sword Specialization - Passive Humans get +5 to Sword skill \line\bullet  Mace Specialization - Passive Humans get +5 to Mace skill. \line\line Detect stealth is marginally useful as you have to activate it. This means you have to know something is stealthed before hand. Also mages can train to use swords but most use staves for the stat bonuses. The sword skill bonus is nice but you will probably be shooting wands more than swinging your weapons. The spirit boost is ok for reducing downtime in PvE but mages get spells to enhance health and mana regen so we have little to no downtime as it is. Admittedly at the end game rep grind the Diplomacy can have a huge effect on reputation gain and grinding. \line\line\cf2 Gnome \cf0\line\line\bullet  Escape Artist - Activate to break out of a Root or Snare effect - Instant - 1 min cooldown \line\bullet  Expansive Mind - passive Increase Intelligence by 5% \line\bullet  Arcane Resistance - passive All Gnomes get +10 Arcane Resistance \line\bullet  Technologist - passive 15 skill bonus to Engineering. \line\line If you want to be an engineering mage then a gnome might be a good choice. The escape artist is marginally useful from breaking out of snares and such, but you can buy items that do the same thing. Arcane resistance is decent for in PvP. \line\line\cf2 Troll \cf0\line\line\bullet  Berserking (active): Increases your attack speed by 10% to 30%. At full health the speed increase is 10% with a greater effect up to 30% if you are badly hurt when you activate Berserking. Lasts 10 sec. \line\bullet  Regeneration (passive): 10% health regen bonus, 10% active in combat \line\bullet  Beast Slaying (passive): 5% damage bonus to Beasts \line\line\line With Trolls the passive health regen is really usefull to mages soloing PVE.\line\line\cf2 Undead \cf0\line\line\bullet  Will of the Forsaken - Activate to become immune to fear, sleep, and charm effects - lasts 5 sec - 3 min cooldown. \line\bullet  Cannabalize - Activate to regenerate 7% of total health every 2 sec. by consuming Humanoid or Undead corpses within 5 yds - lasts 10 sec - 2 min cooldown \line\bullet  Underwater Breathing - passive Underwater breath increased by 4x \line\bullet  Shadow Resistance - passive All Undead get +10 Shadow Resistance. \line\line Cannibalize which allows you to eat humanoid or undead corpses to regain health faster, which is decent benefit while PvE'ing and lifetaping. The second undead active ability only really shines in PvP and is Will of the Forsaken, which is 5 seconds of immunity to fear, charm, sleep and will break you out of fear upon activation but not sleep/seduce. If you plan to play on a PvP server Will of The Forsaken or WoTF can be game changing.\line\line\cf2 Blood Elf \cf0\line\line\bullet  Arcane Affinity - passive Enchanting skill increased by 10. \line\bullet  Arcane Torrent - active - (Hunters/Paladins/Mages/Priests/Warlocks only) \line Silences all enemies within 8 yards for 2 sec. In addition, you gain 5 + 1/Level Mana restored per Mana Tap charge currently affecting you - Instant - 2 min cooldown. \line\bullet  Magic Resistance - passive All resistances increased by 5. \line\bullet  Mana Tap - active Reduces target's mana by 51 and charges you with Arcane energy for 10 min. This effect stacks up to 3 times. Amount of mana reduced is 50 + 1/Level - 30 yd range - Instant - 30 sec cooldown. \line\line The ability to perform an AE silence as a warlock in PVP seems wonderful in addition to the mana returned. Although I must say warlocks already have a plethora of mana returning options through talents and spells, this seems to be additional icing on the cake. The lack of caster monsters makes the arcane torrent and mana tap abilities a little less helpful in PVE as a consistent help.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\par

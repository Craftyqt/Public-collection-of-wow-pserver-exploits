This is intended for those new to glider and also the specific profile pack contained can be used by anyone, This is just a started point for many users, If you think the guide is missing something the please drop a post in a friendly manner and i will try my best to add it to the guide.\line\line Thank You For Your Time\cf0\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b The Druid\b0\line\line Druids are versatile hybrids. They perform different roles using a form appropriate for that role; they can have high armor and rage like a warrior in Bear Form, stealth and fight in melee like a rogue in Cat Form, or heal and nuke with spells in humanoid form. Through talents, they can enhance one or more of these roles and even gain a new form for healing (Tree Form) or nuking (Moonkin Form). \line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Available to: \cf0 Night Elves, Tauren\line\bullet  \cf2 Type: \cf0 Hybrid, Primary Healer\line\bullet  \cf2 Standard Bars: \cf0 Health/Mana (Druid form/Aquatic form), Health/Rage (Bear form), Health/Energy (Cat form) \line\bullet  \cf2 Available Armor: \cf0 Cloth, Leather\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Weapons: \cf0 Staves, Maces, Two-Handed Maces, Daggers, Fist Weapons \line\bullet  \cf2 Comments: \cf0 Excellent soloing class; excellent healers \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Talent Trees\b0\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Balance - \cf0 Balance Druids specialize in their assortment of damage spells and special abilities including an additional Moonkin Form, turning them into an efficient ranged spellcaster that is somewhere between a mage and a shadow priest in play style in the equivalent of plate armor, they lack true AoE capabilities but excel at nuking single targets as well as providing effective off-healing and crowd control support for their group or raid. The Burning Crusade brought the Balance tree enough power to make a properly geared balance druid decent competition with the pure caster classes for top DPS position.\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Feral - \cf0 The Feral tree enhances both of the druid's melee forms, allowing them to tank and melee DPS more efficiently. The talents in this tree usually enhance both forms equally and specialization into one of the two roles depends mostly upon gear. Feral druids are effectively a warrior and a rogue with the ability to heal themselves to boot. Lack of downtime between fights and flexibility in their armor and DPS are their strong points.\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Restoration - \cf0 Druids take points in improving their assortment of healing spells and also in special abilities including an additional Tree of Life Form. They are powerful healers, however they lack out-of-combat rezzing capacity, because the druid resurrection spell Rebirth has a 20 minute cool-down (at the same time being the only in-combat rez castable on others). Restoration Druids have the best heal over time spells. Together with their very high mana endurance (and their limited rez capability) this makes them arguably the best backup healers in raids.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Race\b0\line\line The race choice is an easy one since you have only two options: a Tauren fighting with the Horde, or a Night Elf as a member of the Alliance. The choice is mostly aesthetic, but the racial abilities do make a little bit of difference in the way you will play your druid. The character stat differences are negligible and they shouldn't affect your decision. If you have friends already playing the game, simply choose based on their faction. \line\line\line\cf1 Night Elves -\cf0  Most notable ability is Shadowmeld, very handy in many PvP encounters. Also Wisp Spirit minimizes downtime after death. Quickness increases dodge rate and thus survivability.\line\line\cf1 Tauren - \cf0 War Stomp (stun) and Endurance (5% Health boost). \line\line Which class has better racial abilities usually boils down to an argument of Warstomp vs. Shadowmeld and Wisp Spirit. Warstomp is powerful in any situation, saving us from death in PvE content and annoying gnomes to no end in PvP. Shadowmeld can be handy since you don't have to shapeshift to enter stealth and is believed to increase the players level of stealth and Wisp Form makes dying a little more bearable. \line\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b How Does a Druid Function?\b0\line\line If you decide to create a Druid you will find it's a playstyle that rotates often to take advantage of every enemy weakness. For example, if your enemy is a hard hitter but doesn't have any ranged attacks, you can open a fight by rooting them in place and casting spell damage from a safe distance. When the Roots break away and they come into melee range you can shift into bear form and finish them off from behind your high armor rating. In the next fight you might go up against a caster, sneaking in close with cat form and tearing through their weak armor. The fast attack speed of cat form is effective at interrupting the enemy's casting. \line\line When you reach level 40, another playstyle option comes into the rotation if you follow the Balance talent tree. Moonkin form boosts your armor but utilizes your humanoid offensive spells. It plays like something of a battle mage, casting spells but not sweating it when the enemy gets in close. \line\line You will get used to frequently changing forms and styles in reaction to changes in situation. In warning, some players actually find this frustrating. If you think it would be fun to be in cat form all the time, you might consider playing a Rogue instead. At times even a balance Druid needs to leave moonkin form for bear to be effective. \line\line The downside to all this versatility is that the class doesn't really come into it's own until the late 30s and early 40s. It takes a patient player to get through the tough levels where we feel weak compared to other classes, but in the end we can hold our own against anyone. \line\line Solo, a Druid almost never has to stop and rest. A feral Druid regenerates mana while fighting and a balance Druid can gain mana through melee attacks. In instances and at the end game you will be valued primarily for your ability to heal or to tank, though you will still deliver in the damage category. That is, if you are any good. \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Best Druid Stats ?\b0\line\line Since we do a little bit of everything, we need a little bit of everything. Ideally, if we were going into a fight blind, we would have a decent amount of every stat and bonus available. Since we typically do know what role we are filling, what our personal playstyle is, and what to expect in the next fight, we often want to focus on stats that help us most. \line\line Here is a prioritized listing of what to focus on for what specialized roles you will play in groups. Keep in mind that only the five primary stats are readily available until the mid-50 levels and up. \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Healing Druids -\cf0  +Healing, Intellect, Mana Regen, Spirit \line\bullet  \cf2 Nuking Druids -\cf0  +Spell damage, +Spellcrit, Mana Regen, Intellect, Spirit \line\bullet  \cf2 Melee Druids -\cf0  Strength, Agility, Attack Power, Crit, Hit \line\bullet  \cf2 Tanking Druids -\cf0  Armor, Stamina, Agility, Defense, Dodge, Strength\line\line There will be many influencing factors that change these priorities around a little such as PvP vs PvE, particulars of a boss fight, etc. In PvP, for example, stamina becomes much more important to every role. For the most part while leveling you just need to make sure you aren't neglecting anything.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\par
\b Druid Quests\b0\line\line The first Druid class quest comes from your trainer at level ten along with the spell Teleport: Moonglade. Mathrengyl in Darnassus or Turak in Thunderbluff will send you to the sanctuary of the druids for your first lesson in shapeshifting. \line\line The Moonglade is inaccessible to non druid players until level fifty or so, and even then requires some work gaining acceptance with the Timbermaw Furbolgs before anyone can travel their tunnel unharmed. You will find flight paths to the cities of Darnassus and Thunderbluff and both Night Elves and Tauren live peacefully here.\line\line\line\cf2\b Bear Form\b0  \cf0\line\line When you first arrive in the Moonglade you will be next to a small building on top of a hill. Enter and proceed to the second floor where you will find Dendrite Starblaze ready to guide you to learning your first feral shapeshift, bear form. \line\line Dendrite will first send you out into the Moonglade to find the Great Bear Spirit just a short walk to the northwest. After talking with the spirit cast Teleport: Moonglade again to get quickly back to Dendrite, who will in turn send you back to your class trainer in the city. You can find flight masters in the southwest part of Nighthaven or you can use your hearthstone to get home. \line\line As a test of your worth as a druid, your trainer will send you to defeat Lunaclaw, found in The Barrens for Tauren and in Darkshore for Night Elf druids (click the link and see the maps at the bottom of the page). Once you find the Moonkin Stone, summon and defeat Lunaclaw, speak to his spirit, and return home again to learn how to shapeshift to bear form.\line\line\cf2\b Cure Poison\b0  \cf0\line\line After getting to level 14 your class trainer will give you another quest sending you to the Moonglade. See if you can get your hands on 5 [Earthroot] before you go. You will need them in a bit. Cast Teleport: Moonglade and learn that Dendrite wants you to find out what has been poisoning nearby wildlife. \line\line Alliance druids will be sent to Cliffspring Falls in Darkshore, and Horde druids will go to Dreadmist Peak in The Barrens to gather a sample of the water. You will be delivering the sample to another druid, either Alanndarian Nightsong in Darkshore or Tonga Runetotem in The Barrens. \line\line These local druids need your help to mix a curative potion to restore the health of some local animals. If you haven't found any earthroot yet, you can buy them from Hula'mahi right there in The Crossroads, though I believe the nearest vendor for alliance is in Stormwind. \line\line Alliance druids will also need to gather Lunar Fungus from the same cave you went to for the bear form quest. Horde druids must collect horns from the kodo most easily found in the north part of the barrens. \line\line Once you turn in these materials your quest giver mixes a salve and asks that you help administer it. I'm sure you've seen the Sickly Deer and Sickly Gazelles walking around by now. Get close to one and use the salve by right clicking it in your bag or by dragging it onto an action button. \line\line Cure ten of them and return to the Moonglade for a nice offhand reward. Dendrite will then send you back again to your trainer to learn Cure Poison. \line\line\cf2\b Aquatic Form\b0  \cf0\line\line At level 16 you will be sent once again to Dendrite, who will give you thirty minutes to go swimming around Moonglade's Lake Elune'ara looking for a shrine bauble. It spawns in a few spots around the lake, so watch your breath meter and look for the bauble container on the lake floor. \line\line Once you find the bauble, head to the Shrine of Remulos west of the lake and just off the path. Use the bauble (right click it) to end the quest and talk to Tajarri on the edge of the shrine. Tajarri will send you in search of two halves of the Pendant of the Sea Lion, clues about which you can hear from the two flight masters in Nighthaven. \line\line Each half of the pendant is found in a Strange Lockbox in different parts of the world. Alliance druids head to Darkshore and Westfall and Horde will visit The Barrens and Silverpine Forest. \line\line For the Half-Pendant of Aquatic Agility you will be searching areas that require you to fight through enemies. For the Half-Pendant of Aquatic Endurance you will be looking in very deep places on the edge of the sea, just before you see the fatigue bar appear. In all locations there should be a fissure next to the lockbox, allowing you to breath normally while you open the lockbox and cast Teleport: Moonglade or use your hearthstone. \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b The Class\b0\line\line\line You will be using the "OOberDruid" Custom Class for leveling, \line\line\ul\b NOTE: You MUST USE GLIDER 1.56 OR ABOVE TO COMPILE THIS CLASS\ulnone\b0\line\line\cf2\b OOberDruid\b0  \cf0\line\line\b Installation:\b0\line\line 1.

This is intended for those new to glider and also the specific profile pack contained can be used by anyone, This is just a started point for many users, If you think the guide is missing something the please drop a post in a friendly manner and i will try my best to add it to the guide.\line\line Thank You For Your Time\cf0\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b The Paladin\b0\line\line Paladins are Holy Warriors and are a hybrid class. They can tank, heal, or deal physical and holy damage at close range. Paladins also have very strong group support and buff abilities. They can wear heavy plate armor and carry shields, but are also efficient healers, which combine to produce their renowned durability in combat. With talent specialization and equipment selection, paladins can fill the role of tank, offtank, or healer, and excel when called upon to spot-fill all these roles in a group setting. \line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Available to: \cf0 Blood Elves, Draenei, Humans, Dwarves\line\bullet  \cf2 Type: \cf0 Hybrid, Secondary Healer\line\bullet  \cf2 Standard Bars: \cf0 Health/Mana\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Armor: \cf0 Cloth, Leather, Mail, Plate (level 40), Shields\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Weapons: \cf0 One and Two-Handed Maces, One and Two-Handed Swords, Two-Handed Axes, Polearms \line\bullet  \cf2 Comments: \cf0 A more melee-oriented hybrid \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ============\line\line\b Talent Trees\b0\line\line Paladins train in three schools: Holy, Protection, and Retribution. Which talent trees the Paladin spends points in determines the Paladin's role in parties and raids. Holy Paladins will mainly be expected to be main healers. Protection Paladins are going to be at least off-tanks, if not a main tank. Retribution Paladins will be DPS "Holy Warriors". \line\line The noticeable thing about Paladin talent trees is that none of the 41 point talents are as potent as many other classes 41 point talents. This reinforces that Paladins are meant to become talent hybrids, spending points in different schools\line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Holy - \cf0 The Holy tree contains talents focused on healing and caster-related buffs. Common raid oriented Holy builds will invest at least 20 points into the tree. \line\line A typical 20 talent point investment should include Divine Intellect(5/5), Spiritual Focus(5/5), Healing Light(3/3), Imp Lay on Hands(2/2) and Illumination(5/5) \line\line And for the 21 point talent selection, Divine Favor. \line\line Raiding holy paladins will want to invest at least 20 points into the holy tree. Pick up Divine Favor along with Sanctified Light and Holy Power(5/5) as synergy talents that will benefit Illumination to a much greater extent. \line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Protection - \cf0 The Protection tree contains talents focused on defense, damage mitigation, damage return and one-handed weapons. \line\line A typical healing raiding paladin who selects talents in protection will invest 11 talent points in the protection tree, selecting Imp Devotion Aura(5/5, the new addition giving you much needed armor to tank against enemies and allowing you to have to heal a bit less), Guardian's Favor (2/2), Precision (3/3 the less you miss your target when refreshing JoL/JoW the faster you can get back to healing), and finally Blessing of Kings(1/1) since an extra 10% to everyone's stats takes the edge off of new encounters and speeds up Raid progression. While Blessing of Sanctuary, the most underrated Paladin buff of all, can be a very useful spell in raid situations, it requires to sacrifice many other useful talents, that might be a lot better if you go for the usual buff'n'heal combination. \line\line A potent tanking raiding paladin would normally invest at least 49 talent points in the protection tree, giving enough for a 10-point talent in Holy or Retribution. The great thing is the diversity of the Protection tree, so pick anything that suits your playing style. Try putting talents on Devotion Aura, Redoubt, and Sacred Duty so your most potent aura is powered up and you block more attacks. You can also proc Blessing of Sanctuary with Redoubt more often. Sacred Duty is incredible for any scenario. Even if you normally won't attack while bubbled, you also get a reduced cooldown! So try combos that work for different situations. \line\line The rest of the protection tree is only usable if you plan to PvP or to tank a lot. With points spent in Redoubt, Toughness, Blessing of Sanctuary and Holy Shield you can kill most melee fighters without breaking a sweat, while Toughness, Anticipation and Reckoning combined with enough points in Retribution for Seal of Command will allow you to be a good tank in most instances. Also, try using Exorcism and Holy Wrath to do incredible aggro especially on undead enemies (be wary, for these skills burn up your mana). \line\line The protection tree is not as designed as the warrior's against enemy spellcasters, since your damage output comes from blocking and being hit by melee damage, and your improved armor and defense will not lower spell damage at all. With Reckoning however, at close proximity to casters, higher damage output may be dealt. Improved Hammer of Justice is excellent if they're trying to cast, so not only do you interrupt them, but you can also get in heals more frequently. Also, with Sacred Duty, you can use Divine Shield while still pummeling spellcasters without slowing or stunning effecting you, and like before, more time for healing as well. \line\line Ardent Defender is a good choice if you've spent many points in Protection. The half-dmg will go a long way versus any opponent. Once combined with a seal and judge of wisdom (while using the mana gained for Flashes of Light and Hammer of Justice, many people think JoL, but your risking if it procs or not), the paladin becomes unstoppable. Damage is halved, but healing from SoL and JoL is the same. \line\line Avenger's Shield is also a much needed addition to paladins. It has awesome chain-reacting power that can also slow enemies. It's also an incredible aggro builder. Since it chains and hits up to 3 people, you can pull a group out without much trouble from others, and also do some good starting damage. \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Retribution - \cf0 The Retribution tree contains talents focused on damage output, two-handed weapons, holy damage, and damage avoidance. \line\line For paladins interested in melee combat, a core investment of 16 points will be needed. Benediction (5/5 it is difficult to acquire melee gear with lots of AP/Crit and Int, so the 15% reduction in cost to the Seal/Judgement system will increase your damage much more than Imp Blessing of Might), Imp Judgement (2/2), Deflection (3/5), Seal of Command(1/1), and Conviction (5/5). \line\line For those interested in being a hardcore melee paladins, 30 points can be invested in the tree. Hardcore melee paladins will have to decide whether or not to invest their last talent point in retribution for Repentance (ranged paladin stun) or Divine Favor in the holy tree for a free crit heal. \line\line Building off of the 16 core retribution talents, DPS paladins may want to invest in a Five point combination of Pursuit of Justice(if you have an epic mount you will move at 205/210/215% of normal speed instead of 200% as the talent wording might lead you to believe, but mostly used for normal mounts until lvl 62 as Crusader Aura doesn't stack along with PoJ) - note this talent doesn't stack with run speed & riding skill enchants, Carrot on a Stick or Mithril Spurs; Eye for an Eye(X/2), Vindication (X/3 alright in PvP, but mostly almost all bosses in raid instances are immune), or the last two points of Deflection. Then, Two-handed weapon specialization(3/3), Sanctity Aura(1/1), and Vengeance(5/5 a synergy talent of Conviction) to bring you up to 30.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ==============\line\line\b So What Are Paladins Good For? \b0\line\line The role of the Paladin is certainly one that has changed over time. Once considered to be only good for the sidelines and support, they are now being chosen over classes that have always been thought of to be the be-all end-all of that area. \line\line A tanking Paladin can sometimes be more desirable than a warrior or druid pre-raid. The abilities and mechanics of a Paladin tank are extremely well suited for tanking multiple mobs more effectively than a warrior. \line\line Healing Paladins are the best single-target healer in the game. Their mana efficiency is much better than any other class, allowing for constant healing over long periods of time. These types of Paladins are wanted for raiding and arena fighting. \line\line A Paladin, unfortunately is not known very well for doing damage. Many who roll a Paladin will disagree with me at the beginning, as a Paladin pre-50 can and will do damage to rival that of other DPS classes. However, damage plateaus around 50 with very little boost at end-game. \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ==============\par
\b Should I Roll a Warrior Or a Paladin? \b0\line\line The counter-question to this is... what do you want to do? \line\line If you want to tank and only tank, a warrior is probably for you. You can get good gear and talents to take hits from the strongest, most bad-ass enemies in the game. More raiding guilds will prefer a Warrior tank, although a Paladin tank is not unheard of in end-game raids. \line\line If you want to swing around a big-two handed weapon and do a lot of damage while still being able to take a hit, then Warrior is still probably for you. Warrior damage far outpaces Paladin damage. \line\line However, if you want to do it all then a Paladin is for you. If you want to live forever with 5 or 6 mobs pounding at you, then a Paladin is for you. If you want to ensure that a tank can stay alive while being able to take a beating yourself, then a Paladin is for you. If you want to be the center of attention in a party, able to help out every class in a way that other classes can't.... then a Paladin is definately for you.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ==============\line\line\b Race \b0\line\line\cf1 Humans -\cf0 They can see stealthed enemies for a short period of time with an ability, get a 10% bonus to spirit, 10% more faction gain, and 1% chance to crit with swords and maces. None of these are really great for a Paladin, although the faction gain will help out a lot at endgame. \line\line\cf1 Dwarves -\cf0 Can instantly become immune to Bleed, Poison and Disease effects while increasing their armor by 10% for 8 seconds. Get 1% chance to crit with guns (useless) 10 Frost Resistance and can find treasure chests on the mini-map. Stoneform can be very useful if you need to get a nasty bleed effect off you, also the 10% armor can give you a little bit more DR. The treasure finding is nice too.\line\line\cf1 Draenei -\cf0 Get a moderate Healing over Time spell, increases chance to hit with melee attacks by 1% for your entire party, gives 10 Shadow Resistance and increases your Jewelcrafting skill by 5. The Draenei's HoT spell can definately come in handy for a healing Paladin, and the 1% chance to hit for the party is another nice thing to consider. \line\line\cf1 Blood Elves -\cf0 Mana Tap is an ability that lets you steal mana from an enemy and buff yourself for 10 minutes, this stacks up to 3 times (which do nothing by themselves). At any point in time, you can use Arcane Torrent to use those stacks and gain mana for yourself. Also, get an enchanting bonus of 10 and a resistance to all magic by 5. An interesting thing to note is that mana tap has a 30 yard range, and will be the only ranged attack you can do until Holy Shock if you are speccing in the holy tree or Avenger's Shield in the Protection tree. Very useful for pulling mobs that have mana. \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b The Class\b0\line\line\line You will be using the "OOberPaladin" Custom Class for leveling, \line\line\ul\b NOTE: You MUST USE GLIDER 1.56 OR ABOVE TO COMPILE THIS CLASS\ulnone\b0\line\line\cf2\b OOberPaladin\b0  \cf0\line\line\b Installation:\b0\line\line 1.

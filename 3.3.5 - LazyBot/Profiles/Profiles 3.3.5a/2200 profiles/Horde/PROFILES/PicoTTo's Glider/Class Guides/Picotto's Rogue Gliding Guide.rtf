================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b The Guide\b0\line\line\cf1 Please note: These guides are just to offer some basic information about the class and also one of the many differant talent builds avalible. This is intended for those new to glider and also the specific profile pack contained can be used by anyone, This is just a started point for many users, If you think the guide is missing something the please drop a post in a friendly manner and i will try my best to add it to the guide.\line\line Thank You For Your Time\cf0\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b The Rogue\b0\line\line Rogues excel at dealing melee damage and incapacitating their foes, particularly low health and low armor targets such as casters. Stealth gives them a tactical advantage and allows them to start a fight on their own terms. Other important abilities include lockpicking and the creation and handling of poisons. Also, a huge power is the Rogue's ability to stun and incapacitate for a large period of time. This, paired with the rogue's high damage, gives him a huge edge over his opponent. Rogues do not use mana for their combat abilities. Instead they use energy and generate combo points which are used to execute finishing moves.\line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Available to: \cf0 Blood Elves, Gnomes, Humans, Dwarves, Night Elves, Orcs, Undead, Trolls\line\bullet  \cf2 Type: \cf0 Primary Melee Damage Dealer\line\bullet  \cf2 Standard Bars: \cf0 Health/Energy \line\bullet  \cf2 Available Armor: \cf0 Cloth, Leather\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Weapons: \cf0 Dagger, Thrown, Swords, Bows, Crossbows, Maces, Fist Weapons\line\bullet  \cf2 Comments: \cf0 Favorite among those who like to deal damage \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Stealth\b0\line\line Rogues have the ability to stealth and become essentially invisible, while moving at slower speed. Stealthed rogues are detectable at close range, though will remain stealthed and appear translucent. Many rogue abilities require stealth, and others require being behind the target, which is often achievable (while solo) only in stealth. Other rogue abilities, notably Sprint and Distract, interact well with stealth, although some actions, like lockpicking, will break stealth. \line\line Stealth opens up a range of tactics and roles for rogues. Groups often rely on a rogue's stealth ability to scout dungeons, and to use Sap for added crowd control. In PvP, stealth combined with burst damage gives an element of surprise that can be especially effective against cloth-wearers. \line\line Stealth can be improved through talents, items, and enchantments, both to decrease the chance of being detected, and to increase movement speed.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Poisons \b0\line\line The Poisons skill is a secondary skill, similar to Cooking or First Aid, that is available only to Rogues. \line The Alliance's poison quest can be obtained at level 20 in Westfall from Agent Kearnen called [24] Klaven's Tower; if you drop by S1:7 in Stormwind, Master Maithias will send you to Kearnen when the time is right by giving you the [20] Mathias and the Defias quest.\line The Poisons skill allows the Rogue to brew poisons, which can then be applied to their weapons. Poisons generally either cause damage to the target (either instantly or as damage over time) or cause other effects (slowing the target, removing the effectiveness of healing on the target, etc.). Different weapons can have different poisons applied, and faster weapons cause the poison to proc more often. \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Talents\b0\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Assassination - \cf0 This is a tree based on large amounts of burst damage in contrast to sustained damage found in the combat tree. It makes your poisons less resistible and enables you to rack up more combo points in combat, allowing you to unleash more finishing moves. It's very effective end game in both instances and PvP due to larger, more frequent crits and more effective poison applications. \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Combat - \cf0 This is a great tree for a leveling rogue. It's very good at helping a rogue survive with many great defensive moves such as Riposte, Deflection, and Lightning Reflexes. It's also good at racking up your dps with moves like Sword Specialization and Dual Wield Specialization. This is great for a rogue who wants to not rely on his opener and be able to dish out even sustained DPS with plenty of defensive moves to boot. \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Subtlety - \cf0 The Subtlety tree complements rogues who like to stay in the shadows. The tree is based on moving fast and staying hidden while racking up as many combo points in the opening move as possible. With Initiative and Premeditation you can open combat with 4 or 5 combo points racked up, giving you an excellent edge at the start of a fight. \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b What Do Rogues Do ?\b0\line\line In PvP, our job is to be sneaky and fight when our opponents are least prepared. Killing an enemy when they are already nearly dead and/or out of mana is perfectly acceptable as a Rogue. If you are concerned with your personal honor, the Rogue class isn't for you. Blizzard has chosen to give Rogues very little in the way of survivability in combat with the excuse that Stealth is powerful enough. \line\line In PvE, what we do is very simple. We kill things. We have a few skills to help groups, but for the most part, we're all about doing damage. If you like seeing big, pretty crits and being on top of the rest of the group in damage, Rogue is what you're looking for. \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\par
\line\b Race\b0\line\line\line\cf1 Night Elves\cf0\line\line - Racial Ability: Shadowmeld. Basically a watered down stealth that doesn't let you move. Also increases your effective stealth level. This is why most Allies choose Night Elf for their Rogues. \line - Racial Traits: Quickness (1% increased dodge), Wisp Spirit (50% increased movement speed while dead), Nature Resistance (+10 Nature Resistance) \line\line A solid race to pick for Rogue. Their racial ability can be very nice when fighting other rogues. \line\line\cf1 Human \cf0\line\line - Racial Ability: Perception. Increases stealth detection for 20 seconds. 3 minute cooldown. Also very nice for fighting other Rogues. It goes without saying that you must know the Rogue is there for this to be useful, so don't consider it gank protection. \line - Racial Traits: The Human Spirit (5% increased Spirit), Diplomacy (10% bonus to reputation gain), Sword/Mace Specialization (Increased Sword and Mace Skill by 5) \line\line Another solid race. The increased weapon skill is nice for combat, and Perception is nice in PvP. If I were Alliance, I'd have chosen Human. \line\line\cf1 Gnome \cf0\line\line - Racial Ability: Escape Artist. Removes all movement impairing effects. 60 second cooldown. Very nice PvP tool. Quick cooldown makes for very effective use in BGs. \line - Racial Traits: Expansive Mind (+5% Intellect), Arcane Resistance (+10 Arcane Resistance), Engineering Specialist (+15 Engineering Skill) \line\line Not the best race for a Rogue, but a good race in general. Escape Artist will save you in PvP more often than you think. \line\line\cf1 Dwarf \cf0\line\line - Racial Ability: Stoneform. 8 Second immunity to poisons, diseases and bleed effects, as well as 10% increased armor. 3 minute cooldown. Nice to use before a Vanish so you don't get knocked out instantly due to Warrior/Rogue DoTs. Not much other use for a Rogue. \line - Racial Traits: Gun Specialization (+5 Gun Skill), Frost Resistance (+10 Frost Resistance), Treasure Finding (activate to show treasure chests on the minimap, no cooldown) \line\line Probably has the least useful abilities and traits for Rogues, though any race can make an effective Rogue. \line\line\line\cf1 Orc \cf0\line\line - Racial Ability: Blood Fury. Increases Attack Power by 6 + (your_level -1) * 4 for 15 seconds. 2 minute cooldown. That's 242 Attack Power at level 60, and 282 at 70. Decreases all healing effects by 50% for 15 seconds. 2 minute cooldown. This adds a very large amount of damage while it's active, and is a very powerful ability in PvE. Also useful in PvP, but to a lesser extent. \line - Racial Traits: Hardiness (15% stun resistance), Command (+5% pet melee damage), Axe Specialization (+5 Axe Skill) \line\line A good choice for a Rogue. The stun resistance will save you against other Rogues very often, and occasionally against Warriors. Blood Fury makes you a PvE powerhouse, where you can throw out 2500 damage Eviscerates in raids when your cooldowns are ready. The best PvE choice for a Rogue. \line\line\cf1 Undead \cf0\line\line - Racial Ability: Will of the Forsaken. Removes all Fear, Sleep and Charm effects, also grants a 5 second immunity to said effects. 2 minute cooldown. An extremely useful PvP ability. If PvP is your primary focus, this alone should be enough to make up your mind, as classes that can Fear repeatedly often give Rogues the most trouble. \line - Racial Traits: Underwater Breathing (Stay underwater 4 times longer than other races), Shadow Resistance (+10 Shadow Resistance), Cannibalize (consume a nearby Humanoid or Undead corpse to restore 35% of your health over 10 seconds). \line\line The best PvP choice for a Rogue. People constantly complain about how overpowered Will of the Forsaken is, so enjoy it. \line\line\cf1 Troll \cf0\line\line - Racial Ability: Berserking. Increases attack speed by 10% to 30% for 10 seconds. The lowest benefit is obtained at full health, and vice versa. 3 minute cooldown. Not a bad ability, but if you're just looking for a damage increase ability, Orcs are better. \line - Racial Traits: Regeneration(10% increased health regeneration, 10% health regeneration allowed in combat), Beast Slaying (5% increased damage against beasts), Throwing Weapon Specialization (+5 Throwing Weapons Skill), Bow Specialization (+5 Bow Skill). \line\line Not really a very good Rogue race compared to the others available. Trolls were designed more with Hunters in mind. \line\line\cf1 Blood Elf \cf0\line\line - Racial Ability: Mana Tap. Activate to drain 50 mana from your target and charge yourself with arcane energy for 10 minutes. Stacks 3 times, 30 second cooldown. Scales with level. \line - Racial Ability: Arcane Torrent. Silences all enemies within 8 yards for 2 seconds and restores 10 energy/12 mana per Mana Tap affecting you. Scales with level. \line - Racial Trait: Arcane Affinity (+10 Enchanting Skill), Magic Resistance (+5 all resistances) \line\line Promises to be a very powerful PvP race. With the new post-60 silence effects Rogues are getting and Improved Kick, it would be possible to keep a caster silenced for an extended period of time, while still dealing decent damage.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Weapons\b0\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Daggers \cf0\line\line A very popular choice. Daggers excel at doing a lot of damage in a very short period of time. Ambush, Backstab and Mutilate have ridiculously high base damage, along with exceptional crit chance for the first two. Daggers, however, have been plagued by poor Combo Point generation, which made the talent Seal Fate a popular pick. With the addition of Mutilate (the single most energy efficient CP generation), this is no longer such a huge problem for Dagger builds. Daggers also have the highest crit chance of any weapon, as the Dagger talents such as Improved Backstab/Ambush and Dagger Specialization add crit chance, and lots of it. I'm personally nearing 40% with full raid buffs as Combat Daggers. Daggers make for excellent raiding builds, and decent PvP builds. Mutilate is a very nice jack-of-all-trades build, and also happens to be superb for raiding at level 60, and not a far off second to Combat Daggers at 70. \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Swords \cf0\line\line Probably the best weapon to use with PvP, as it allows for high instant attack damage without having to be behind your target or stealthed. Particularly slow swords (2.8 or slower) combined with a high attack power (in the 1800+ range) can be used with Hemorrhage with great success. Swords are also the strongest grinding build, as you are not reliant on stunning your target to do high damage instant attacks. \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Maces \cf0\line\line A close second in grinding power if you can find a good one. The Mace Specialization stun effect is extremely useful in all situations. Aside from the Mace Specialization talent, you can treat these exactly as you would a sword. There are some very nice maces out there, but Blizzard really needs to show Maces and Fist Weapons a little more love. \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Fist Weapons \cf0\line\line Think of Fist Weapons as Swords with the Dagger Specialization talent. Their Damage and Speed is about the same as a Sword (they're a little bit faster on average), but Fist Weapons have the added bonus of having some very, very fast weapons should you desire that in your offhand. An excellent weapon type plagued by poor itemization (that means there aren't many good ones). If you've got a nice set, by all means use and enjoy them, but don't go out there expecting to be fist specced from the start. \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Main Hand versus Off Hand \cf0\line\line A very common question, and for good reason. The question of what weapon type seems to be the most common, and the answer is very simple. If you're not Mutilate specced, your offhand weapon type makes absolutely no difference aside from the Combat talents that effect only one weapon type. \line\line That being said, what you actually do put in your offhand is a bit more involved than that. Your offhand weapon does 50% damage (75% with Dual Wield Specialization maxed out), so getting higher damage weapons will have a much lower effect than doing so on your main hand. This applies to attack power bonuses as well. The off hand weapon is not used for instant attacks, aside from Shiv, either, so that frees up all damage range considerations entirely. \line\line Now, the end all, be all answer. All other relevant stats equal (DPS, base stats, attack power, etc), faster is better for every build except Mutilate. There are three reasons for this. \line\line\line 1. Poisons are a set proc rate, and are not normalized to weapon speed like Enchantments are. This means that if Weapon A is exactly twice as fast as Weapon B, Weapon A will proc your poisons exactly twice as often (on average, though I realize an exact average is an oxymoron). \line\line 2. More swings means more spell interrupts. Most classes get talents that reduce this chance, but frequent interrupts can be the difference between life and death in a very close match. Granted, it's not a big difference, but if the stats are identical between weapons, why not take any advantage you can get? \line\line 3. Combat Potency. If you're combat, each offhand hit gives you a chance to gain energy. More attacks means more energy. More energy is more damage. More damage means a better Rogue.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\par

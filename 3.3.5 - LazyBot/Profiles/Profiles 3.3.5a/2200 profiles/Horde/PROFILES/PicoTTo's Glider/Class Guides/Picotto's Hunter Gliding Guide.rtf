This is intended for those new to glider and also the specific profile pack contained can be used by anyone, This is just a started point for many users, If you think the guide is missing something the please drop a post in a friendly manner and i will try my best to add it to the guide.\line\line Thank You For Your Time\cf0\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b The Hunter\b0\line\line Hunters are the only class that can effectively use ranged weapons (e.g. bows, guns, or crossbows) as a primary source of damage. Very adept at kiting, they have plenty of tools to allow them to avoid melee combat, where they are fairly weak. Hunters may tame many varieties of beasts to serve as combat pets, which along with an array of scouting, tracking, and survival abilities make them excellent solo characters.The three talent specializations for hunters are Marksmanship, Beast Mastery, and Survival. \line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Available to: \cf0 Blood Elves, Draenei, Night Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Tauren, Trolls\line\bullet  \cf2 Type: \cf0 Ranged Physical Damage Dealer\line\bullet  \cf2 Standard Bars: \cf0 Health/Mana \line\bullet  \cf2 Available Armor: \cf0 Cloth, Leather, Mail (level 40)\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Weapons: \cf0 Axes, Daggers, Guns, Bows, Crossbows, Fist Weapons, Polearms, Staves, Swords, Thrown, Two-Handed Axes, Two-Handed Swords\line\bullet  \cf2 Comments: \cf0 Excellent for those who like to solo with pets \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Pets\b0\line\line Pets are the most important tools in the hands of a hunter. They serve as aggro-management, additional DPS, and tanking. While the manner in which a pet is customarily used differs fairly greatly, depending on the Hunter's spec, the pet is still essential to all specs. A well trained pet of the appropriate type can add upwards of 120 DPS to a Hunter's overall damage output; so while they are customarily thought of as tanks, their offensive potential should not be overlooked. \line\line Many beast-type mobs can be tamed, and each offer a set of unique active skills (there are special abilities just for wolves, just for cats, etc). In addition, certain pet types are tanking oriented (such as bears), and others are DPS oriented (such as cats and owls). Combined with the diversity of armor, stamina and resistance buffs, pets are allowed a great deal of customization. Many hunters have dedicated pets for specific instances, PvP, tanking, and so on. \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Pets Scaling\b0\line\line Pets receive attribute bonuses depending on their master's stats: \line\line 1 RAP gives the pet 0.22 AP and 0.1287 spell damage \line 1 stamina gives 0.3 stamina \line 1 resistance gives 0.4 resistance \line 1 armor gives 0.35 armor \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b What Is a Hunter Good For ?\b0\line\line Hunters are the ranged combat class in WoW. Since they don't (really) have magic, they have some limited combat abilities for if something does get in their face. They also have beast pets whose primary purpose is to allow them to use ranged combat while soloing. \line\line After level 40, they wear stronger armor than any classes other that warriors or paladins, (but they can not use shields like shamans,) plus other defensive abilities such as a high dodge rate. They can also use all weapons other than maces or wands. Hunters are excellent soloists and arguably the best pullers in the game. Unfortunately neither of these skills come into play much during most groups. \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b When Do i Get ?\b0\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Pets -\cf0  level 10 \line\bullet  \cf2 Dual Wield -\cf0  level 20 \line\bullet  \cf2 Aspect of the Cheetah -\cf0  level 20 \line\bullet  \cf2 Feign Death - \cf0 level 30 \line\bullet  \cf2 Mail armor proficiency -\cf0  level 40 \line\bullet  \cf2 Steady Shot - \cf0 level 62 \line\bullet  \cf2 Aspect of the Viper - \cf0 level 64 \line\bullet  \cf2 Kill Command -\cf0  level 66 \line\bullet  \cf2 Misdirection -\cf0  level 70 \line\bullet  \cf2 Shields - \cf0 never. \line\bullet  \cf2 Plate armor -\cf0  never. \line\bullet  \cf2 A well-defined group role -\cf0  never. \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b What Are The Most Important Attributes For Hunters ?\b0\line\line Agility (which adds attack power and chance to crit) is number one. No questions asked. That doesn't mean you should switch items because one has a single point of agility more if you are sacrificing other stats, though. \line\line Stamina and Intellect are of some benefit to hunters. Stamina is often preferred, but some hunters argue that a hunter should not get hit, and thus more HP is irrelevant...but more mana lets them fight longer, so they try to get intellect. \line\line\line Later in level, you will start seeing other qualities on equipment. Agility is good because it increases your Attack Power and your chance to crit. There are items that specifically increase one of those two factors, and are important to your damage output. Mana per 5 seconds (MP5) helps you keep your mana high while shooting and thus keeps you doing damage for a longer time. There are also Hit Rating bonuses that make you less likely to miss. \line\line While usually the last thing hunters look at, defensive attributes like armor and chance to dodge are of some limited benefit. Agility also increases your chance to dodge, as well as your armor. \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Do The Math\b0\line\line 1 (Ranged) attack power = 1/14 tooltip DPS \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Agility \cf0\line\line 40 Agility = 1% crit \line 21 Agility = 1% dodge \line 1 Agility = 1 Ranged Attack Power \line 1 Agility = 1 Melee Attack Power \line 1 Agility = 2 Armor \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Crit/Hit \cf0\line\line 22 Crit Rating = 1% Crit \line 1% Crit = 1% of your tooltip DPS, or 1.3% with Mortal Shots \line 15.75 Hit Rating = 1% Hit \line Note: To prevent misses you need +5% hit when fighting opponents of your level, and 9% when fighting raid bosses. \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Intelligence \cf0\line\line 1 Intelligence = 15 Mana, plus some mana regen w/ Aspect of the Viper \line 1 Intelligence = 0.45 Attack Power w/ Careful Aim \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\par
================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Talent Trees\b0\line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Key Beast Mastery Talents\cf0\line\line\cf1 Improved Aspect of the Hawk -\cf0  If you are involved in end-game raiding, this talent can significantly increase your DPS rate over a sustained period of auto-attacking.\line\line\cf1 Endurance Training - \cf0 The 15% boost to your pet's health can mean two or three extra hits before going down. \line\line\cf1 Thick Hide -\cf0  Reduces the damage your pet takes in battle. Really pays off when you are faced with two or more opponents. This combined with Endurance Training can save you mana from having to heal your pet as often. \line\line\cf1 Unleashed Fury -\cf0  Increases your pet's damage which also pays off in increasing its ability to maintain aggro. \line\line\cf1 Bestial Swiftness -\cf0  Does provide noticeable help in getting your pet to and from the target. Well worth the one point it will cost. Use it as backfill. \line\line\cf1 Improved Mend Pet -\cf0  A must-have for the long term. The ability to remove debuffs from your pet reduces your downtime and increases your pet's longevity in fights, especially with those long, annoying debuffs. \line\line\cf1 Ferocity - \cf0 Anything that increases your pet's ability to damage the target is good as it means faster fights and less chance of losing aggro. \line\line\cf1 Intimidation -\cf0  A great means of interrupting spell casters and also for giving you and your pet a few seconds to recover or inflict damage without taking any yourself. This spell also works well if your pet needs to steal aggro away from you or from casters in your party. Finally, while this is a primarily PvE talent, the stun aspect can make a difference in PvP encounters. \line\line\cf1 Bestial Discipline - \cf0 This allows your pet to use his specials and growl more often keeping the aggro on the pet and off of you. \line\line\cf1 Frenzy - \cf0 Another damage increase that pays off mightily. Also great against casters, who are having hard time when your pet is frenzied and keeps interrupting their casting. \line\line\cf1 Serpent's Swiftness -\cf0  Main DPS increaser in the tree. Passive 20% white DPS to you and your pet. Scales incredibly well, and provides a significant damage boost. Worth about a 10-15% DPS increase at 5/5. Note: It is not a 20% DPS increase because special attacks aren't affected as much. \line\line\cf1 Bestial Wrath - \cf0 The focus of the tree. Pays off in PvE and PvP. Increased damage and immunity to almost every CC effect cannot be underestimated. Great when you need your pet to finish off one mob to move to another quickly. This skill easily increases the maximum level mob you and your pet can solo by 2 to 5. \line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Key Marksmanship Talents\cf0\line\line\cf1 Improved Concussive Shot -\cf0  This talent provides one of the only opportunities a Hunter has to prevent a spell from being cast, along with Intimidation in the Beast Mastery tree. It also provides the opportunity to kite your opponent or run away from them. Essential PVP talent. Much less useful in late-game PvE, and nearly useless in raiding, as many high-level mobs are immune to stun effects. \line\line\cf1 Improved Hunter's Mark -\cf0  Good mainly for PvE, and for Beast Mastery Hunters crossing into Marksmanship for Mortal Shots, lets your Mark provide some AP to any melee classes in your party, as well as your pet. Not nearly as useful as Improved Concussive Shot for PvP. \line\line\cf1 Lethal Shots -\cf0  Straight DPS upgrade. Coupled with Mortal Shots, is almost essential. \line\line\cf1 Aimed Shot - \cf0 Also the essential means of taking down spell casters quickly with a huge upfront punch. \line\line\cf1 Rapid Killing -\cf0  Decent in both PvP and PvE, although moreso in PvP. The cooldown reduction on Rapid Fire is good, and the 20% damage buff increases the punch on any opener you throw within a reasonable timeframe. (Note: still procs off mobs that would yield experience if you are level-capped) \line\line\cf1 Concussive Barrage - \cf0 Useless. Only procs off of Auto-Shots, with an abyssmally low rate. Utterly useless in end-game raiding, where the things most likely to have it proc on them, bosses, are almost all immune to stun. \line\line\cf1 Scatter Shot - \cf0 Great PvE means to give yourself a few seconds of safety. No minimum range also makes this a good way to get back in range in PvP. Works well on non-beasts (otherwise, use Scare Beast). \line\line\cf1 Mortal Shots -\cf0  A must-have for almost any Hunter. The 30% buff to your critical hits applies to all of your shots as well, significantly increasing your DPS. Also one of the primary reasons to pick up Aimed Shot, which has only limited utility after 2.0. \line\line\cf1 Trueshot Aura -\cf0  A bonus the hunter can provide his groupmates with. Rogues, DPS warriors and beast mastery/survival spec hunters will love you for this. \line\line\cf1 Careful Aim -\cf0  Excellent talent for those going deep into Marskmanship. Allows you to gain more benefit from the Int you need for Aspect of the Viper. \line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Key Survival Talents\cf0\line\line\cf1 Hawk Eye -\cf0  +6 yard range should not be underestimated: It gives hunters the best range of any class in the game. Although the advantage of this in PvP should hopefully be self-explanatory, the benefit of this skill in solo PvE is primarily due to Survival's damage being crit based. As such, even after the pet loses aggro, with this skill, if a Hunter begins at maximum range from their target, they should still be able to kill the target before it reaches melee range. \line\line\cf1 Humanoid Slaying - \cf0 With the first three talents, this and Monster Slaying are the best to get. Deflection may not be worth it, as your mail armor and parry quite possibly are enough to keep you alive until you are safely back in gun/bow range, especially if you have Improved Wing Clip. \line\line Note: Deflection If you plan on getting counterattack this is a must-have talent. \line Improved Wing Clip - This talent allows you a possible root to make range on your target and also getting in one or two hits with your melee weapon before getting some distance to the mob. \line\line\cf1 Deterrence -\cf0  25% bonus to parry and dodge can be the difference between life and death, especially in PvP/Heroics and even in Raids. But a difficult talent to choose if you wish to make a Mortal Shot mm/ss build. \line\line [color=blue] Surefooted - You get both a boost to your chance to hit as well as the possibility of negating root effects. The +hit wont show on the character sheet, but Hunters with this talent can safely choose more gear wihout the +hit stat. Though somewhere around 3-4% more will be needed if you do highend raiding - while Hunters without this talent needs around 6-8% depending on which instances/raids the Hunter does. \line\line\cf1 Killer Instinct -\cf0  Increasing the critical strike chance of all your attacks is key - especially if you go for the Expose Weakness talent. \line\line\cf1 Counterattack -\cf0  Cannot be avoided by your opponent, but you can miss. It will root your target and does damage all after you successfully parry attack. \line\line\cf1 Lightning Reflexes -\cf0  A 3-15% increase in Agility. This talent is the backbone of a dedicated Survival Hunter's ranged damage. Agility is the primary stat needed to make use of Survival; it provides attack power, %crit, %dodge, and armour. It also allows one of the best dps debuffs in WoW - Expose Weakness. \line\line\cf1 Wyvern Sting - \cf0 Originally the trademark Survival talent. Wyvern's strength isn't primarily as an extended duration form of crowd control, but rather as an initial opening stun or surprising move which can throw an opponent off-guard, and also leaves the Hunter free to perform a follow up sequence of attacks. While it can also be used as a failsafe in the event that a freeze trap fails, this is risky, and requires that the non-crowd controlled target(s) in a given scenario be killed quickly. If used in addition to a freeze trap, this makes a Survival hunter one of few who can crowd control up to three mobs at the same time. \line\line Note: This ability, when combined with Freezing traps allows a hunter to leave 3 mobs out of combat instead of one or two. Initially, the hunter lays a Freezing trap and waits a bit for the cooldown of traps. Then pull group regularly or open with wyvern - wyvern can now be shot in combat which makes it alot more usefull, so one generally likes to wait with that shot. The first mob to chase the hunter gets trapped. Then put a new freezing trap down a little away from the first trapped mob and if you didint open with wyern sting you now shoot one to sleep and let the third mob run into the last trap. With improved traps you should now have three mobs CC\'b4ed for approx 27, 23 and 12 seconds. Then start your kiting and spam new traps as the old one brakes. Remember that if you feign death you will reset all aggro, so be sure they wont cause problems for the rest of the group/raid. \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\par

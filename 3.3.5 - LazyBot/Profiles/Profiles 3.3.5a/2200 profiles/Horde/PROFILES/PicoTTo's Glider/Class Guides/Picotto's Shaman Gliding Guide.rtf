This is intended for those new to glider and also the specific profile pack contained can be used by anyone, This is just a started point for many users, If you think the guide is missing something the please drop a post in a friendly manner and i will try my best to add it to the guide.\line\line Thank You For Your Time\cf0\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b The Shaman\b0\line\line Shamans are one of the most versatile classes in the game as they can switch seamlessly from offensive caster to healer to melee DPS as needed, though at later levels they often specialize in one of these roles. Shamans can provide good support to a party, with the ability to step in and fill any role that may be lacking at the moment. Their high burst damage and healing also make them quite good at PvP. They are able to drop stationary totems on the ground which provide a variety of effects, many of which are useful to their entire party. They are unique in that they can provide complete wipe recovery by self-resurrecting and then resurrecting the rest of the party. \line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Available to: \cf0 Draenei, Orcs, Tauren, Trolls\line\bullet  \cf2 Type: \cf0 Hybrid, Secondary Healer\line\bullet  \cf2 Standard Bars: \cf0 Health/Mana\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Armor: \cf0 Cloth, Leather, Mail (level 40), Shields\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Weapons: \cf0 One-Handed Maces, Two-Handed Maces (w/ talents), Staves, One-Handed Axes, Two-Handed Axes (w/ talents), Daggers\line\bullet  \cf2 Comments: \cf0 A more magic oriented hybrid \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Talent Trees\b0\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Elemental - \cf0 The Elemental tree focuses on the Shaman's spellcasting ability, in the form of offensive totems (fire totems), spells, and 'shocks' (instant-cast spells of various elements). One of the major boons of this tree is to decrease the mana cost and casting time of offensive spells and totems while increasing their damage and critical strike chance. The seventh tier ability is Elemental Mastery, a spell usable every three minutes that guarantees a mana-free critical hit on the Shaman's next offensive spell. Elemental greatly improves the damage output of a shaman's magical offense. This works well in PvP and for soloing, though some argue it is less effective in end-game raids. In 2.0, Elemental Shamans received the option of training Totem of Wrath, a totem for partying that increases your whole party's critical strike and hit chance with spells by 3%. \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Enhancement - \cf0 The Enhancement tree focuses on the Shaman's ability to cast timed enchants on their own weapons, and expands on their melee ability in general as well. This is a very appealing tree to lower-level shamans because of the 5% mana increase, reduced cast time on their travel spell, Ghost Wolf, and the ability to dual-wield weapons. At later levels, Enhancement specialized Shamans can deal large amounts of melee damage, equaling and sometimes even surpassing that of a Warrior or Rogue, though the lack of a threat-reducing ability can make it difficult to manage aggro. One of the seventh tier abilities is Stormstrike, which grants an attack with both weapons and increases the damage of the next two Nature spells on the target by 20%. Combined with other abilities to gain extra strikes, particularly Windfury Weapon, Stormstrike can be used to great effect. Enhancement greatly reduces PvP survivability, in large part due to having to be up close in order to deal damage, though it offers significant improvement for the shaman's melee damage output. With the release of 2.0, Shamans are now able to dual wield weapons through this tree. \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Restoration - \cf0 The Restoration tree focuses on the Shaman's healing capability, reducing the casting time and mana cost of healing spells and totems, while increasing their effectiveness. Shamans specced in Restoration are quite useful in end-game parties as effective healers, buffers, and backup casters. The end-tree talent in the Restoration tree is the Earth Shield, which is a shield with ten charges that can be self-cast as well as placed on party member, which heals the user upon being struck once every few seconds for an amount that can crit and is affected by the shaman's +healing and +spell critical strike. Restoration greatly enhances shaman contribution to group/raid PvE content, but severely limits a shaman's damage output. With the new changes (as of the 2.0.1 patch) deep restoration has become a very viable PvP spec because of the new shaman spell Earth Shield as well as Nature's Guardian, which has a chance to heal the shaman for 10% of the shaman's total health when the shaman's health is reduced to below 30% by a damaging attack.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Race\b0\line\line\cf1 Draenei -\cf0  The healing benefits every three minutes from Gift of the Naaru comes in handy when soloing, and the +1% hit chance aura not only helps you, but your party as well. \line\line\cf1 Orcs - \cf0 Axe Specialization, Blood Fury (str boost), Hardiness (inc. resistance to stun/knockout). \line\line\cf1 Tauren - \cf0 War Stomp (stun) and Endurance (5% Health boost).\line\line\cf1 Troll - \cf0 The worst Horde race in terms of racials. The 2 notable abilities are Berserking, which increases Attack Speed depending on health levels, and Regeneration, which allows 10% of health regeneration to continue in combat and slightly reduces downtime out of combat. \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Best Shaman Stats ?\b0\line\line Enhancement Shaman will want a mix of Strength, Agility and Stamina. \line Elemental and Restoration will want a mix of Intelligence, Spirit and Stamina. \line\line Elemental Shaman benefit from +Spell Damage \line Restoration Shaman benefit from +Healing \line\line Shamans want to focus on MP/5 Gear if they are Resto or Elemental. It greatly helps our sustainability with our low MP. Also, since Shamans roles tend to have them casting alot (Totem Dropping, Shocks, Weapon Buffs/Lightning Shield, Heals) they are usually better off gaining MP/5 instead of Spirit Gear at the upper levels.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Totems\b0\line\line The four elemental totem types become available by way of certain quests. These quests become available several levels below the level at which the totem spells become trainable, ensuring that a Shaman need not go out of their way to complete them immediately. Obviously, they should be completed as soon as possible, but find quests in the same area so as not to waste time. \line\line Selecting totems to maximum advantage is more art than science - sometimes, it may be most efficient not to drop any totems at all, especially when not in a party. Only one totem of each element can be used at a time, and this must be considered when choosing the combination that is most beneficial. Other factors include which party members can gain advantage from which totems, and which totems will affect your target. For example, Stoneskin Totem only affects people being attacked, whereas Strength of Earth Totem will improve all melee DPS. This makes Stoneskin useful when your casters are going to AoE, or possibly against Cleaving mobs, while Strength of Earth is likely to be better at other times. Similarly, Searing Totem will deal extra damage, but in close proximity to other mobs, it may accidentally aggro an add before you have a chance to use Totemic Call. Similarly, the AoE fire totems, Magma Totem and Fire Nova Totem, may break crowd control effects if placed too close to controlled mobs. \line\line It is also a good idea to consider requests from your party members, as some classes will prefer different totems based on specs - a Combat Rogue will love Windfury Totem, but an Assassination Rogue will prefer Grace of Air Totem, as Windfury does not stack with Poisons. \line\line Several totems have an aggro radius, including Mana Spring Totem, Healing Stream Totem and Earthbind Totem, as well as the damage-dealing Fire totems, and Stoneclaw Totem. Elemental totems do not have an aggro radius, but the Elementals themselves do. It should be noted that Fire Nova Totem will draw aggro as soon as it is cast, causing any untapped mobs in the area to try to destroy it before it goes off. As this totem is best suited for encounters with multiple mobs, it is advisable to threaten all nearby mobs, such as with a Chain Lightning pull, or to use it in conjunction with a Stoneclaw Totem. \line\line To best manage your totems, a totem timer mod is recommended. This will enable you to use Totemic Call just before they time out, giving some extra mana efficiency before replacing them. \line\line Also note that totems activate the Global Cooldown, meaning it will take at least 4.5 seconds to place all four totems. It is therefore advantageous to place totems before a pull.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\par
\b Weapons\b0\line\line All Shamans can use staves, two-handed axes and maces, one-handed axes and maces, daggers, fist weapons, and shields. \line\line Most mid- and high-level Shamans carry several weapons - generally a two-handed weapon, a one-handed weapon, and a shield. Lower-level characters will generally choose one weapon set, and not carry spares. Dual Wielding Shamans will, of course, carry a second one-handed weapon. Weapon choice will change depending on the situation, and your spec. \line\line Enhancement Shaman will almost always use their chosen specialized weapon combination, preferring to DPS down the mobs before they take much damage. \line Elemental Shaman will almost always prefer a shield to assist them in taking less damage. In instances, they may choose to use a staff, if their staff has better stats (intellect, +damage, spell crit, etc) than their one-handed weapon and shield combination. \line Restoration Shaman will make their choice similar to Elemental Shaman, although their important stats will be different. \line Some basic tips for selecting a weapon combination: \line\line Against melee opponents, you may want to use your shield to mitigate damage. \line Against casters, use the 2H weapon. Spells ignore armour when determining damage so the shield provides little value. Your goal is to kill them quickly using both weapon damage and spells. \line When healing, the weapon's attributes should determine which configuration you choose as you will most likely not be engaged in combat as a healer. For example, if your staff has a +int buff on it, then you would select that weapon so as to increase your mana pool.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Weapon Buffs and Speed\b0\line\line\cf2 Flametongue Weapon:\cf0  Ignores damage reduction due to high armor, high, steady damage, a great all-around buff for grinding, PvE, PvP. \line\line\cf2 Frostbrand Weapon:\cf0  Procs fairly often, decent burst damage, has a very useful movement slowing effect. Also popular for elemental and restoration shamans because its damage is raised by +spell damage. \line\line\cf2 Rockbiter Weapon:\cf0  Must bypass damage reduction due to high armor, but offers high, steady damage. Use against mobs with high fire resistance. Great with high crit chance. \line\line\cf2 Windfury Weapon:\cf0  Unbeatable burst damage, procs fairly often, can easily win a PvP fight but very unpredictable with regard to aggro management. Best with slow weapons (but still very good with fast ones), great with high crit chance and can deliver some massive returns when combined with the Shamanistic Rage talent. \line Fast weapons are recommended for non-Stormstrike/non-PvP Shamans, especially Elemental and Restoration Shamans, who should use Flametongue Weapon, as Flametongue scales much better on faster weapons. Dual-wielding Enhancement Shamans are encouraged to use slow weapons and Windfury on both of the weapons \line\line\line Before The Burning Crusade, two-handed weapons were recommended for Enhancement Shamans, particularly in PvP. This was because Windfury would hit, and often crit, dealing a lot of damage. Immediately following a Windfury proc with Stormstrike and Earth Shock would often result in an instant kill, before the target had a chance to heal, be healed, or run. \line\line With the changes to Windfury since the release of the expansion, coupled with the much larger health pools of level 70 characters in relation to damage caused, a slow two-handed weapon will not cause enough burst damage to kill a target outright, even with a Windfury crit. However, the high burst damage is still powerful and hard to heal, and two-handed weapons are still devastating in PvP. \line\line As an alternative, enhancement shamans may choose to wield two weapons. Dual-wield weapons should be slow (2.60) to maximize Stormstrike and Windfury effect. Enhancement shamans Critical Strike will activate Flurry and Unleashed Rage. Combined with moderate hit and crit ratings, these useful effects will basically always be on. Placing Windfury Weapon on the main hand weapon while placing Frostbrand Weapon on the offhand will result in bit lower damage, but the enemy-slowing Frostbrand proc is a deadly combination in PvP. \line\line\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b The Class\b0\line\line\ul\b NOTE: You MUST USE GLIDER 1.56 OR ABOVE TO COMPILE THIS CLASS\ulnone\b0\line\line You will be using the "OOberShaman" Custom Class for leveling, \line\line\cf2\b OOberShaman\b0  \cf0\line\line\b Installation:\b0\line\line 1.

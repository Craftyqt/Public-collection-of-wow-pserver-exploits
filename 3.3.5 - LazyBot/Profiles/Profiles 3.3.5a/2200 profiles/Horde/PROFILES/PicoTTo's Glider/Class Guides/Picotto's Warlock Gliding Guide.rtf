This is intended for those new to glider and also the specific profile pack contained can be used by anyone, This is just a started point for many users, If you think the guide is missing something the please drop a post in a friendly manner and i will try my best to add it to the guide.\line\line Thank You For Your Time\cf0\line\line\cf2 This Guide Has Also Been Translated To German By Derrene Here :\cf0  http://wow.glider-forum.de/f106/ultimative-deutsche-piclock-hexenmeister-guide-long-8772.html\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b The Warlock\b0\line\line Warlocks enslave demons and call upon dark magic and curses to dominate and destroy their foes. Like hunters, warlocks employ combat pets, but these are summoned demons rather than tamed beasts. They are primarily ranged magic damage dealers with a focus on damage over time in addition to nukes and AoE, but lack the extreme burst damage capabilities of a mage. Demon pets and fear spells give them a variety of tactical options, and they have several utility spells and abilities, including summoning party members and creating healthstones and soulstones.\line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Available to: \cf0 Blood Elves, Gnomes, Humans, Orcs, Undead\line\bullet  \cf2 Type: \cf0 Debuffer and Cool Guy/Girl\line\bullet  \cf2 Standard Bars: \cf0 Health/Mana\line\bullet  \cf2 Pet Bars: \cf0 Health/Mana\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Armor: \cf0 Cloth\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Weapons: \cf0 Daggers, Wands, Swords, Staves\line\bullet  \cf2 Comments: \cf0 Excellent solo class\line\bullet  \cf2 Main Stats: \cf0 Stamina and Intellect\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Minions\b0\line\line\cf2 Imp: \cf0 Level Obtained: Varies (obtainable as early as 1, usually 4 though)\line\line The Imp's main role is a support minion, designed to do additional damage alongside the caster via its Firebolt attack. The Imp is very fragile and will die very quickly if attacked, but it requires no Soul Shard to summon, and is often used to farm new Soul Shards when you run out and cannot summon a different minion.\line\line\cf2 Voidwalker: \cf0 Level Obtained: 10\line\line This demon deals little damage, but has very good armor and good hit points. He is excellent while soloing, because he is an excellent tank, is able to keep aggro and has high armor and health.\line\line\cf2 Succubus: \cf0 Level Obtained: 20\line\line The Succubus is replete with spells that deal damage and mesmerize the enemy in different ways.\line\line\cf2 Felhunter: \cf0 Level Obtained: 30\line\line The Felhunter is your anti-caster minion. Where the Succubus deals lots of melee damage, the Voidwalker is a great tank and the Imp deals lots of ranged damage, the Felhunter has high magic resist and has abilities to Counterspell, remove buffs from enemies and remove debuffs from friendlies\line\line\cf2 Infernal: \cf0 Level Obtained: 50 - Obtained through "Grimoire of Inferno" or "Kroshius' Infernal Core"\line\line While it deals better melee damage than the Succubus, has higher HP, fire immunity, and more AC than a Voidwalker; it needs to be enslaved (with the Enslave Demon spell) after the first five minutes. This demon can break loose unexpectedly, causing it to turn on its former master.\line\line\cf2 Doomguard: \cf0 Level Obtained: 60\line\line The Doomguard is one of the most powerful Warlock minions. It has high HP and AC, as well as having Rain of Fire, Dispel, Cripple and Warstomp. A properly used Doomguard can take out entire camps of enemies at a time before perishing. However, like the Infernal, it requires Enslave Demon to be cast on it to stay within the Warlock's control, but unlike the Infernal, it MUST be enslaved right away, or it will start attacking you or your party/raid. \line\line\cf2 Felguard: \cf0 Obtained from the 41st point of the demonology talent tree\line\line The Felguard is the most powerful non-enslaved Warlock minion. Overall effectiveness compared to other warlock minions is in a rapid state of flux. It has similar DPS to the succubus, while tanking almost as well as the Voidwalker (having slightly less armor but much better single target aggro generation. This demon has abilities that help a lot in PvP as well as when soloing. It uses the standard single soul shard to summon. \line\line\line\cf1 Pet Scaling \cf0\line\line\bullet  1 Stamina gives 0.3 to your pet. \line\bullet  1 Resistance gives 0.4 to your pet. \line\bullet  1 Armor gives 0.35 armor to the pet. \line\bullet  1 Spell damage gives 0.15 spell damage, and 0.57 attack power to your pet. \line\bullet  1 Int gives your pet 0.3 int. \line\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Races\b0\line\line\cf2 Human \cf0\line\line\bullet  Perception - Activate to increase stealth detection radius by 10 yards - lasts 20 sec \endash  3 min cooldown \line\bullet  The Human Spirit - passive Increase Spirit by 10% \line\bullet  Diplomacy - Passive 10% bonus to faction point gain \line\bullet  Sword Specialization - Passive Humans get +5 to Sword skill \line\bullet  Mace Specialization - Passive Humans get +5 to Mace skill. \line\line Detect stealth is marginally useful as you have to activate it. This means you have to know something is stealthed before hand. Also warlocks can train to use swords but most use staves for the stat bonuses. The sword skill bonus is nice but you will probably be shooting wands more than swinging your weapons. The spirit boost is ok for reducing downtime in PvE but warlocks get spells to enhance health and mana regen so we have little to no downtime as it is. Admittedly at the end game rep grind the Diplomacy can have a huge effect on reputation gain and grinding. \line\line\cf2 Gnome \cf0\line\line\bullet  Escape Artist - Activate to break out of a Root or Snare effect - Instant - 1 min cooldown \line\bullet  Expansive Mind - passive Increase Intelligence by 5% \line\bullet  Arcane Resistance - passive All Gnomes get +10 Arcane Resistance \line\bullet  Technologist - passive 15 skill bonus to Engineering. \line\line If you want to be an engineering warlock then a gnome might be a good choice. The escape artist is marginally useful from breaking out of snares and such, but you can buy items that do the same thing. Arcane resistance is decent for in PvP. \line\line\cf2 Orc \cf0\line\line\bullet  Blood Fury - Increases attack power by about 4 per character level (282 at 70), but reduces healing effects on you 50%. Lasts 15 sec. \line\bullet  Hardiness - passive 15% resistance to stun and knockout effects. \line\bullet  Command - passive Pet melee damage increased by 5% \line\bullet  Axe Specialization - passive Orcs get +5 to Axe skill. \line\line The stun resistances orcs are reporting are more like 3% at most so that is not a great bonus. Warlocks can't use axes, but the pet damage bonus can be helpful. Blood fury boosts spell damage similar to the attack power boost.\line\line\cf2 Undead \cf0\line\line\bullet  Will of the Forsaken - Activate to become immune to fear, sleep, and charm effects - lasts 5 sec - 3 min cooldown. \line\bullet  Cannabalize - Activate to regenerate 7% of total health every 2 sec. by consuming Humanoid or Undead corpses within 5 yds - lasts 10 sec - 2 min cooldown \line\bullet  Underwater Breathing - passive Underwater breath increased by 4x \line\bullet  Shadow Resistance - passive All Undead get +10 Shadow Resistance. \line\line Cannibalize which allows you to eat humanoid or undead corpses to regain health faster, which is decent benefit while PvE'ing and lifetaping. The second undead active ability only really shines in PvP and is Will of the Forsaken, which is 5 seconds of immunity to fear, charm, sleep and will break you out of fear upon activation but not sleep/seduce. If you plan to play on a PvP server Will of The Forsaken or WoTF can be game changing. The most common strategy warlock in PvP is to fear kite your opponent. Alliance warlocks often complain about undead and their WoTF as an "I win" button in PvP especially undead rogues. The shadow resistance is good for fighting alliance warlocks and shadow priests.\line\line\cf2 Blood Elf \cf0\line\line\bullet  Arcane Affinity - passive Enchanting skill increased by 10. \line\bullet  Arcane Torrent - active - (Hunters/Paladins/Mages/Priests/Warlocks only) \line Silences all enemies within 8 yards for 2 sec. In addition, you gain 5 + 1/Level Mana restored per Mana Tap charge currently affecting you - Instant - 2 min cooldown. \line\bullet  Magic Resistance - passive All resistances increased by 5. \line\bullet  Mana Tap - active Reduces target's mana by 51 and charges you with Arcane energy for 10 min. This effect stacks up to 3 times. Amount of mana reduced is 50 + 1/Level - 30 yd range - Instant - 30 sec cooldown. \line\line The ability to perform an AE silence as a warlock in PVP seems wonderful in addition to the mana returned. Although I must say warlocks already have a plethora of mana returning options through talents and spells, this seems to be additional icing on the cake. The lack of caster monsters makes the arcane torrent and mana tap abilities a little less helpful in PVE as a consistent help.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\par
\b Custom Class \b0\line\line For leveling the warlock i reccomend using a PVE custom class, the one im going to use is my own "PicLock" and i will guide you through the settings i use to glide the warlock from 10-70. It uses an afflication spec till level 50 and then switches to a demonology spec to get felguard.\line\line\cf2\b PicLock\b0  \cf0\line\line\b Installation:\b0\line\line 1.

This results in little downtime for the lock and needs minimul food / water.\cf0\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Talents \b0\line\line\line\cf2\b Spec Full Affliction Using Voidwalker Untill Level 50, Then Respec To Demonology Spec\cf0\b0\line\line Level 10: Improved Corruption(1/5)\line Level 11: Improved Corruption(2/5)\line Level 12: Improved Corruption(3/5)\line Level 13: Improved Corruption(4/5)\line Level 14: Improved Corruption(5/5)\line\line Level 15: Improved Life Tap(1/2)\line Level 16: Improved Life Tap(2/2)\line\line Level 17: Soul Siphon(1/2)\line Level 18: Soul Siphon(2/2) \line\line Level 19: Suppression(1/5)\line\line Level 20: Fel Concentration(1/5)\line Level 21: Fel Concentration(2/5)\line Level 22: Fel Concentration(3/5)\line Level 23: Fel Concentration(4/5)\line Level 24: Fel Concentration(5/5)\line\line\line Level 25: Imp Curse Of Agony(1/2)\line Level 26: Imp Curse Of Agony(2/2)\line\line Level 27: Empowered Corruption(1/3)\line Level 28: Empowered Corruption(1/3)\line Level 29: Empowered Corruption(1/3)\line\line Level 30: Nightfall(1/2)\line Level 31: Nightfall(2/2)\line\line Level 32: Siphon Life(1/1)\line\line Level 33: Grim Reach(1/2)\line Level 34: Grim Reach(2/2)\line\line Level 35: Shadow Mastery(1/5)\line Level 36: Shadow Mastery(2/5)\line Level 37: Shadow Mastery(3/5)\line Level 38: Shadow Mastery(4/5)\line Level 39: Shadow Mastery(5/5)\line\line Level 40: Contagion(1/5)\line Level 41: Contagion(2/5)\line Level 42: Contagion(3/5)\line Level 43: Contagion(4/5)\line Level 44: Contagion(5/5)\line\line Level 45: Shadow Embrace(1/5)\line Level 46: Shadow Embrace(2/5)\line Level 47: Shadow Embrace(3/5)\line Level 48: Shadow Embrace(4/5)\line Level 49: Shadow Embrace(5/5)\line\line\b{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/talents/warlock/talents.html?1500222502235105500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/ba...00000000000000}}}\cf0\ulnone\b0\f0\fs24\line\line\line\line\cf2\b At Level 50, Respec To Demonology and Use The Following:\cf0\b0\line\line Level 10: Demonic Embrace(1/5) \line Level 11: Demonic Embrace(2/5) \line Level 12: Demonic Embrace(3/5) \line Level 13: Demonic Embrace(4/5) \line Level 14: Demonic Embrace(5/5) \line\line Level 15: Fel Intellect(1/3)\line Level 16: Fel Intellect(2/3)\line Level 17: Fel Intellect(3/3) \line\line Level 18: Imp Health Funnel(1/2) \line Level 19: Imp Health Funnel(2/2) \line\line Level 20: Fel Domination (1/1)\line\line Level 21: Fel Stamina(1/3)\line Level 22: Fel Stamina(2/3)\line Level 23: Fel Stamina(3/3)\line\line Level 24: Demonic Aegis(1/3)\line Level 25: Demonic Aegis(2/3)\line Level 26: Demonic Aegis(3/3)\line\line Level 27: Master Summoner(1/2)\line Level 28: Master Summoner(2/2)\line\line Level 29: Unholy Power(1/5)\line Level 30: Unholy Power(2/5)\line Level 31: Unholy Power(3/5)\line Level 32: Unholy Power(4/5)\line Level 33: Unholy Power(5/5)\line\line Level 34: Demonic Sacrifice(1/1)\line\line Level 35: Master Demonologist(1/5)\line Level 36: Master Demonologist(2/5)\line Level 37: Master Demonologist(3/5)\line Level 38: Master Demonologist(4/5)\line Level 39: Master Demonologist(5/5)\line\line Level 40: Soul Link(1/1)\line\line Level 41: Demonic Knowlage(1/3)\line Level 42: Demonic Knowlage(2/3)\line Level 43: Demonic Knowlage(3/3)\line\line Level 44: Demonic Resilience(1/3)\line\line Level 45: Demonic Tactics(1/5)\line Level 46: Demonic Tactics(2/5)\line Level 47: Demonic Tactics(3/5)\line Level 48: Demonic Tactics(4/5)\line Level 49: Demonic Tactics(5/5)\line\line Level 50: Summon Felguard(1/1)\line\line Level 51: Improved Corruption(1/5)\line Level 52: Improved Corruption(2/5)\line Level 53: Improved Corruption(3/5)\line Level 54: Improved Corruption(4/5)\line Level 55: Improved Corruption(5/5)\line\line\line Level 56: Improved Life Tap(1/2)\line Level 57: Improved Life Tap(2/2)\line\line Level 58: Soul Siphon(1/2)\line Level 59: Soul Siphon(2/2)\line\line Level 60: Suppression(1/5)\line\line Level 61: Fel Concentration(1/5)\line Level 62: Fel Concentration(2/5)\line Level 63: Fel Concentration(3/5)\line Level 64: Fel Concentration(4/5)\line Level 65: Fel Concentration(5/5)\line\line Level 66: Imp Curse Of Agony(1/2)\line Level 67: Imp Curse Of Agony(2/2)\line\line Level 68: Empowered Corruption(1/3)\line Level 69: Empowered Corruption(1/3)\line Level 70: Empowered Corruption(1/3)\line\line\b{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/talents/warlock/talents.html?1500222500030000000000052030133250100511351000000000000000000000"}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/ba...00000000000000}}}\cf0\ulnone\b0\f0\fs24\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\par

This is intended for those new to glider and also the specific profile pack contained can be used by anyone, This is just a started point for many users, If you think the guide is missing something the please drop a post in a friendly manner and i will try my best to add it to the guide.\line\line Thank You For Your Time\cf0\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b The Priest\b0\line\line Priests are the quintessential healer, and easily the most versatile class in that role, though they may also specialize to become powerful offensive casters. Priests have a wide variety of healing utility spells, along with a few tricks, helpful and otherwise, such as Power Word: Fortitude, Mind Control and the extremely useful Dispel Magic and Cure Disease. Other priests choose to pursue Shadowy arts, gaining the ability to assume Shadowform, increasing their damage output, and at higher levels regenerating mana quickly for their entire party, while sacrificing most of their powerful healing abilities. \line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Available to: \cf0 Blood Elves, Draenei, Humans, Dwarves, Night Elves, Undead, Trolls\line\bullet  \cf2 Type: \cf0 Primary Healer\line\bullet  \cf2 Standard Bars: \cf0 Health/Mana\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Armor: \cf0 Cloth\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Weapons: \cf0 One-Handed Maces, Daggers, Staves, Wands\line\bullet  \cf2 Comments: \cf0 The most sought after class for any group \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Talent Trees\b0\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Shadow -\cf0  Shadow talents primarily enhance a priest's DPS. One of the most important shadow spells gained through Shadow tree talents is Mind Flay, a 3 second channeled spell that causes damage and slows the target to 50% of its movement speed. It has a low mana cost, making it one of the most mana-efficient spells in the game and is first available at level 20. \line\line The Spirit Tap talent is generally the recipient of any priest's first talent point, as it doubles the priest's Spirit and allows 50% mana regeneration while casting for 15 seconds after killing a mob. Another important talent in the Shadow tree is Vampiric Embrace, available at level 30. This shadow spell casts a debuff on a target that heals all party members for 15-25% (depending on talents) of the shadow spell damage the priest deals to it for 60 seconds. \line\line The Silence spell and its prerequisite, Improved Psychic Scream, are utility talents placed in the middle of the Shadow tree. Shadow Weaving can be useful in party and raid situations, as it causes a debuff that lasts 15 seconds, provides a 2% bonus to all shadow damage caused on the target (for example from Warlocks), and stacks up to 5 times. The debuff is applied every time the shadow priest successfully casts a shadow spell on a target, although it is subject to a separate resistance check. \line\line Another vital talent of the Shadow tree is Shadowform, which when activated gives the priest a 15% shadow spell damage bonus and 15% reduction to physical damage taken but entirely prevents the priest from casting Holy spells. (As such, Vampiric Embrace is the only option besides consumables for a priest in shadowform to heal itself.) Some other useful talents in the Shadow tree can cause a 3 second stun on a successful shadow spell cast, reduce the threat caused by shadow spells, and increase the damage the target takes from all sources of Shadow damage. \line\line The new ultimate Shadow talent, Vampiric Touch, causes a 15-second damage over time effect on the target and provides an amount of mana equal to 5% of all shadow damage dealt by the caster to all members of the caster's party while the DOT effect lasts. \line\line One talent added by Burning Crusade is Misery. This talent causes an enemy to take X% more spell damage as long as certain shadow spells afflict it. You can put up to 5 points in Misery, adding up to 5% more spell damage. This is extremely useful in parties and raids as it causes the target to take more damage from all different types of spells, be it holy, shadow, fire, etc. \line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Discipline -\cf0  Discipline allows the priest to be stronger with buffs (such as Power Word: Shield and Fortitude and Inner Fire), more mana conserving, and still able to balance DPS and healing. At the end of this talent category is the spell Pain Suppression. Pain Suppression reduces damage taken from any source by 65% for 8 seconds, granting the Priest extra longevity should the enemy focus on them. Another powerful Discipline spell, Power Infusion grants the target an extra 20% damage and healing buff. Unlike Arcane Power in the Mage's list, this technique allows the priest to give the buff to someone else, and it doesn't have the drawback of consuming extra mana like Arcane Power. \line\line Regrettably, these two techniques do not stack. Also, added with the healing buff, a priest could use this in an intense battle to have higher healing ability. Combining this with a powerful spirit buff, the priest can go on for many battles without running out of mana, especially in instances where the priest heals. This is mainly an end-game category, and quite powerful leveling up as a priest can get an extra 5% spell critical chance as well as a permanent spell damage mod to offensive spells. There are very few priests that don't have a few points in Discipline. \line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Holy -\cf0  The Holy tree increases a priest's healing ability while enhancing their survivability. The final ability is Circle of Healing, an instant heal that not only heals the target, but members of the target's party as well. Priests also have an "improved death", which allows them to become the Spirit of Redemption and heal party members for 15 seconds mana-free. This can easily save a group from being wiped out, and can keep them alive until the enemies are defeated or the priest is resurrected by a druid in battle. Holy priests are the most versatile healers in the game with a variety of tools to sustain their group.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Race\b0\line\line\cf2\b Alliance \cf0\b0\line\line\cf1 Draenei - \cf0\line\line 1)Gemcutting: +5 bonus to Jewelcrafting \line 2)Gift of the Naaru: Targeted heal-over-time agility \line 3)Inspiring/Heroic Presence: +1% chance to hit with spells or attacks,(depending on class.) \line 4)Shadow Resistance: +10 bonus to Shadow Resistance \line 5)Symbol of Hope: regens X amount of many every 5 sec, for 15 secs. \line 6)Fear Ward\line 7)Chastise\line\line\cf1 Dwarf- \cf0\line\line 1)Stoneform: Activated ability that grants immunity to poison, disease,and bleed effects \line 2)Gun Specialization: +5 bonus to guns skill \line 3)Frost Resistance: +10 bonus to Frost resistance \line 4)Treasure Finding: Tracking ability that locates treasure chests on the minimap \line 5)Desperate Prayer:instant self-heal \line 6)Fear Ward \line\line\cf1 Human- \cf0\line\line 1)Perception: Activated ability that increases stealth detection \line 2)The Human Spirit: +10% spirit bonus \line 3)Diplomacy: +10% to reputation increases \line 4)Sword Specialization: +5 bonus to sword and mace skills \line 5)Desperate Prayer:instant self-heal \line 6)Feedback: Any successful spell cast against the priest will burn x of the attacker's Mana and y Shadow damage for each point of Mana burned for 15 secs. \line\line\cf1 Night Elf- \cf0\line\line 1)Shadowmeld: Activated ability outside of combat that puts the Night Elf into stealth while they remain still. \line 2)Quickness: +1% dodge chance \line 3)Wisp Spirit: Become a wisp when dead with movement speed increase \line 4)Nature Resistance: Innate +10 Nature resistance \line 5)Starshards:\line\line\line\cf2\b Horde \cf0\b0\line\line\cf1 Blood Elf- \cf0\line\line 1)Arcane Affinity: +10 bonus to Enchanting \line 2)Arcane Torrent: Silences all nearby opponent for 2 seconds and restores mana or energy for each Mana Tap charge \line 3)Magic Resistance: +5 resistance to all schools of magic \line 4)Mana Tap: Drains mana from target and charges the Blood Elf with arcane energy, stacking up to 3 times \line 5)Consume Magic: which allows you to regain mana by consuming one of your buffs. \line\line\cf1 Troll- \cf0\line\line 1)Berserking: Activated ability that increases attack and casting speed; increased effect when badly injured \line 2)Regeneration: Increase health regen bonus \line 3)Beast Slaying: 5% extra damage dealt when fighting beasts \line 4)Throwing Weapon Specialization: +5 weapon skill for bows and thrown weapons \line 5)Hex of Weakness and Shadow Guard, Shadow Guard is very useful that often procs shadow weaving and also blackout. \line\line\cf1 Undead- \cf0\line\line 1)Will of the Forsaken: Activated ability that makes the Undead immune to fear, charm and sleep effects temporarily \line 2)Cannibalize: Activated ability to consume a corpse and regain health \line 3)Underwater Breathing: Increased ability to last underwater without air \line 4)Shadow Resistance: Natural +10 Shadow resistance \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\par

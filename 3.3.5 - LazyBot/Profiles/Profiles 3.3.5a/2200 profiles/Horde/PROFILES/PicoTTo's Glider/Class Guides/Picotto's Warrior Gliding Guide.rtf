This is intended for those new to glider and also the specific profile pack contained can be used by anyone, This is just a started point for many users, If you think the guide is missing something the please drop a post in a friendly manner and i will try my best to add it to the guide.\line\line Thank You For Your Time\cf0\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b The Warrior\b0\line\line Warriors are close-combat fighters and usually fill the role of primary tank or offtank, as they are able to both withstand and inflict fierce physical punishment and have the most versatile means of generating threat and keeping aggro off other characters. They can also contribute very strong melee DPS when needed. Warrior abilities use rage, which is generated by dealing and taking damage, but decays over time while not in combat. Warriors are highly dependent on their gear, as their ability to deal and take damage is controlled directly by the quality and effects of their weapons and armor. \line\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Available to: \cf0 Draenei, Dwarves, Gnomes, Humans, Night Elves, Orcs, Trolls, Tauren, Undead\line\bullet  \cf2 Type: \cf0 Primary Tank\line\bullet  \cf2 Standard Bars: \cf0 Health/Rage\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Armor: \cf0 Cloth, Leather, Mail, Plate (level 40), Shields\line\bullet  \cf2 Available Weapons: \cf0 All (excluding wands) \line\bullet  \cf2 Comments: \cf0 Excellent for those who like to take damage \line\bullet  \cf2 Main Stats: \cf0 Stamina and Strength\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Rage\b0\line\line\line By default, a warrior's rage bar is empty. Warriors can gain rage by being struck in combat, dealing damage, drinking rage potions, or using certain Warrior Abilities. Most of their abilities require a certain amount of rage in order to be activated. When a Warrior exits combat, any left-over rage slowly decays until the bar returns to empty. The rate at which rage decays can be controlled through talents. A warrior's rage bar will drop to 0 immediately if he switches his stance. At level 20, the passive ability Stance Mastery allows him to retain 10 rage through a stance change, and the Tactical Mastery talent increases this to 25 rage. \line\line Warriors need to be in combat or use a rage-generating ability to generate rage. The longer the battle, the more rage a warrior can accumulate. This often leads the warrior to the strategy of "filling up" his rage bar on a weaker foe before moving on to a more powerful enemy. A warrior with a full rage bar can quickly unload a large amount of damage.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Talent Trees\b0\line\line\bullet  \cf2 Arms -\cf0  A general mix of talents comprised mostly of utility and offensive abilities. The Arms talent tree is capped by the Endless Rage ability, which causes Rage gained from all damage caused to be increased by 25%. The Arms tree mainly enhances burst damage emphasizing powerful (usually slow) two-handed weapons with use of Mortal Strike. Arms warriors usually prefer two handed weapons with high top end damage, as this will increase the potential of the Mortal Strike ability. \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Fury -\cf0  Primarily offensive, the Fury talent tree is capped by the Rampage ability, though the tree really relies on Flurry, and thus critical strikes, to create most of its damage. Fury warriors usually prefer two one handed weapons, with similar priorities as a rogue in terms of stats and weapon damage. For this reason, Fury warriors are sometimes nicknamed "Rogues in plate". \line\line\bullet  \cf2 Protection -\cf0  This tree is all about the proud tradition of swashbuckling: Boastful and taunting, this warrior has specialized in fighting with "sword and board", that is, a weapon in the main hand and a shield in the off-hand. The talents of the protection tree allows you even greater offensive and defensive advantages of this fighting style, allowing you to use the shield as a potent and crippling weapon. Protection talents also allows you to build aggro faster and to greatly enhance your survivability. These abilities are ideal for warriors in a tanking role. In PvP the greater survivability and added capabilities of the protection warrior compensates for the slower damage output. Protection warriors are often referred to as tanks.\line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\line\line\b Race\b0\line\line For more casual gamers, there's really no major difference between the races - choose the race that you want to play, whether for its looks, its voice, or because its simply good fun! \line\line Below is a quick overview of Races from the warrior's perspective - see the Races page for more detailed information which isn't of specific interest to warriors, and the Racial Traits for more detailed explanations of the traits mentioned below. \line\line\cf2\b Alliance \cf0\b0\line\line\cf1 Dwarves - \cf0 Stoneform is handy in PvP and many PvE encounters. \line\line\cf1 Gnomes - \cf0 The instant cast Escape Artist means this race will be a good option versus Mages in particular as well as most other classes. Overall Gnomes tend to be very popular for PvP, mostly due to their small size. \line\line\cf1 Humans - \cf0 Diplomacy's Reputation bonus makes all Human classes worthy, and Sword and Mace Specialization makes Human warriors better at dealing damage with those weapons. Perception helps to see stealthed players/NPCs. The Human Spirit helps reduce downtime in solo play. \line\line\cf1 Night Elves -\cf0  Most notable ability is Shadowmeld, very handy in many PvP encounters. Also Wisp Spirit minimizes downtime after death. Quickness increases dodge rate and thus survivability.\line\line\cf1 Draenei -\cf0  The healing benefits every three minutes from Gift of the Naaru comes in handy when soloing, and the +1% hit chance aura not only helps you, but your party as well. \line\line\line\cf2\b Horde \cf0\b0\line\line\cf1 Orcs - \cf0 Axe Specialization, Blood Fury (str boost), Hardiness (inc. resistance to stun/knockout). \line\line\cf1 Tauren - \cf0 War Stomp (stun) and Endurance (5% Health boost). These make the best tanks for the Horde, even though it is only a small difference. \line\line\cf1 Trolls - \cf0 The worst Horde race in terms of racials. The 2 notable abilities are Berserking, which increases Attack Speed depending on health levels, and Regeneration, which allows 10% of health regeneration to continue in combat and slightly reduces downtime out of combat. \line\line\cf1 Undead- \cf0 Will of the Forsaken makes UD warriors warlock- and priest-killers (as well as being able to seriously threaten other Fear users) as well as being invaluable in PvE encounters where charm, sleep or fear is a factor. Cannibalize is very handy in reducing downtime in solo play and after PvP combat, when used well, but is generally ineffective in PvE groups where a healer is present. \line\line\line All Alliance warriors are good for PvP, but mace- and sword-wielding Humans are considered the best for PvE. Horde are also all good for PvP (Undead being strongest), but Tauren are usually considered the best for PvE due to their 5% health bonus, although Undead warriors make better tanks for some encounters due to their fear immunity from Will of the Forsaken. \line\line ================================================== ================================================== ================\par

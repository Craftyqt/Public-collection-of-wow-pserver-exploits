Things to know:
-Make sure you have your character setup to fight mobs. If you pull a mob you will want to fight it so you can get out of combat.
-Glider is pretty bad at Herbing. 20% of the herbs Glider would just pass over every time I tested the profiles. It was very weird and if anyone knows a fix let me know. I just learned to live with it and Glider was still herbing enought to get me from 1-250 on my shadow priest in about 8 hours. It got stuck at points but it wasn't a big deal. Sometimes it just got stuck for no reason and there was nothing that a profile fix would do.
-You might run a whole profile and not see a single herb because people are farming in the area. This happened to me a couple times and this is why I want to put out more profiles for each level range.

Herbing Ranges:
-These are the ones I used in testing. You may want to adjust them. I found that it doesn't make a huge difference, if Glider detects an herb it cant get to it will blacklist it and turn around.

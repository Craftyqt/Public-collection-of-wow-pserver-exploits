# vanillamultiboxer
A hobby-level project I decided to take up because I couldn't find a multiboxing program for WoW 1.12.1 that I liked.
Basic multiboxer with simple blacklisting/memory reading capabilities.

# How to compile
- Download the source .zip, extract it
- open Multiboxer.sln in Visual Studio 2017
- Press Build -> Build Solution
- Open Multiboxer/bin/Debug/Multiboxer.exe
- Done!

# How it works
- Uses WINAPI messages to send keystrokes all open wow clients
- Requires you to select a client that you will be playing on (the Master Client)
- Will not send keystrokes to the Master

# Features
- Basic blacklisting/whitelisting capabilities
- Basic memory reading capabilities
- Macro generator

1: Instal  wow two times copy paste all the addons from the folder "_LPM-master addons" to your addon folders (on both clients)

2: run Pwnboxe ignore and press no to all script errors.

3: configure keys that you want to global broadcast among your wow clients. (bottom left)

4: assign paths to the clients you will be running  (top left). you can use one client for all your games running but i recommend  using two game paths 1 for the client you will be playing on and one for the clients running in the background (later explained)

5: getting tired of waiting for your game to start, wondering what the fuck is going on? lts a ten year+ game FFS! well here is the solution.  Run NeverAskMeAgain as administrator. as it seems every game that used to run on WinXP is calling home to Microsoft to see if there is a update for that game... and ofc there isnt any. and this will stop that from happening!

6: start all games with PWNboxer (bottem left)

7: open LPM ingame using /lpm and press create macros (top left) drag the macros you just created onto your hotbar and keybind these to F11 and F12

8: Run asd.exe. This is a key spammer. press F1 to activate spam  F12. and press printscreen to activate spam F11 both will give a little bleep when activated and a bleep on a lower tone when de- activated Note: you wont be able to use your shift key while the keyspammer is activated. (dont ask why i did not wrote it but it will fuck shit up. good thing you wont need it anymore as you are now fully running on macros anyway.

9: (optional)if you are using a nvidia graphics card run nvinspector. and create 2 profiles one for your main client and one for your slave clients (use direct path for this). you will need to instal a 2nd wow in another directory for this.  and lower the fps on your slave client's profile to your liking. this is to improve preformance

10: (optional) Write your own macros! this is where the fun starts. Zorlen macros work but are kinda meh. for the ones that dont know how (like me) i have included some macros. just replace "your-name" with your leaders name. and put them in a supermacro slot.(Note dont word wrap it before copy paste) 

thats all, you are now a pro multi boxer ready to kick some ass while chewing that bubble gum!

to find out what the addons you just installed do read the readme's from the addons itself

Enjoy!

--==Version 1.0

Hi
I would like to introduce _LazyPig Multibox - addon that I wrote for easy multiboxing similar to Jamba but for 1.12 client.
It has powerful features thanks to 1.12 API which isn't limited like in TBC and higher.

and some others with older version of _LazyPigMultibox  http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmSTEIQm_2Ly-zjqrV-wgCA

_LazyPig Multibox Advantages

- dynamic GUI designed for easy multiboxing and fast group manage
- predefined class scripts for dps, heal and rez
- implemented _LazyPig, QuickHeal and Zorlen functions to improve level of code
- loot roll and quest share actions controlled from master client
- fast configuration for all clients thanks to "Upload Settings" button
- bug free macro create mechanism

Using _LazyPig Multibox

- open _LazyPig Multibox typing by "/lpm" command or bind selected button
- create multibox macro "/lpm script" using "create macro button"
- use this macro to perform assist, follow, dps, rez, heal and group action - slave

Some Info

I made this addon for Feenix community and I hope you enjoy it, if you find this addon useful for you feel free to share your opinion or idea how to improve.
Some persons really apreciated my previous addons and asked me if they can support me by any way - You can do it by sending some gold to Ogrisch@Warsong 12x  ..thx

Cheers.

--==Version 2.0 

_LazyPig Multibox is now optimized to use with Warlock, Shaman, Paladin and Priest classes - best script support

1) General Improvements
- Greatly Improved GUI
- SmartBuff support
- Fast and Normal healing modes
- Better Event Handler

2) Introduced Sniper Mode (to enable you have to check IMPROVED TARGETING and ACTIVE ENEMY ONLY or ACTIVE NPC ENEMY ONLY) 
- thanks to Sniper Mode we have better pet control in the group, every pet can attack diffrent target using "LazyPigMultibox_SPA" - Expert Mode function or "LPM PET ATTACK" - Novice Mode macro described below

more about Expert and Novice Mode - using_macros_part1.txt


3) added four new functions for best macro efficiency
- LazyPigMultibox_SPA(slave_master_name, icon_index, modifier) --selective pet attack
- LazyPigMultibox_SFL(slave_master_name, task, duration, modifier) -- selective function launch
- LazyPigMultibox_SCS(slave_master_name, spell_name, duration, mana, modifier) -- selective cast spell
- LazyPigMultibox_SUB(slave_master_name, modifier) --selective unit buff

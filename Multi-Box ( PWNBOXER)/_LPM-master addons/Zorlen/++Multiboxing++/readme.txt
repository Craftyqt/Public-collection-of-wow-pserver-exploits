Zorlen is great functions library which you can use in your macros.

for example if you want to make warlock multibox macro

1) warlock spell macros are in Zorlen_Warlock.lua other classes are also supported
2)lets make simple macro for warlock I open the file using any txt or programmer editor and look for spell functions
3) so our macro should look like /script castAutoTap() castCorruption() castCurseOfAgony() castShadowBolt()

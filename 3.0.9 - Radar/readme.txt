Release information:

[5/1/09]: v1.0:

    * Initial Release


[6/1/09]: v1.1:
Technical:

    * Redone in Visual Studio 2008, which means it now uses .NET framework 3.5
    * Added a x86 flag to the build files, this MAY make it work on 64 bit systems (it was previously trying to load a 32bit dll which wouldn't have worked)
    * A few more error handlers, should get less unexplained crashes


Features:

    * Ability to change refresh rate
    * Ability to disable radar


'Security' settings:

    * Ability to rename window
    * Process name can be changed simply by renaming .exe file.


[18/1/09]: v1.3:
Features:

    * Wildcard notification! Now you can use 'vein' to find all veins, or 'boar' to find all boars!
    * Track multiple objects! Use as many search strings as you want.
    * Mouse over names, displays name when you place your mouse over the dot.
    * No longer need to start WoW first, or log in first, or press reload. You can start the program and WoW in whatever order you want. All is automated, it will tell you the loading status at the bottom.
    * One click to reload object list, can be done at any time.


Technical:

    * Implements multi-threading for drawing, should cut down on lag.
    * blp (minimap) loading is fully coded and in the program, but there is one last issue that needs to be fixed before it can be released =/


[24/1/09]: v1.6:

    * No longer uses injection to get names which should stop all crashes.
    * Rotates map correctly around player to align with minimap. (Finally got this working with the name labels, had some coordinate rotation issues)
    * Object dumper now lists items in resizable columns rather than writing "Name: XYZ, GUID: XYZ" for each entry.
    * Updated target offsets - target highlighting now works.
    * BLP Loading has been temporarily disabled until it is more stable.


[5/2/09]: v1.8:

    * It also allows you to save most settings including colours.
    * Ability to load in and save notify list files.
    * Fixes bug where capitals wouldn't work.
    * Added always on top option.
    * Added ability to hide certain types of objects.
    * Allows for sound notifications. Tick sound notification in settings, and it will play SoundNotification.wav (must be in the same folder) whenever a notification bubble comes up.




[14/2/09]: v1.9:

    * Updated offsets to 3.0.9.
    * Fixed Agro -> Aggro typo.
    * Hopefully fixed agro radius bug, should display correctly now.

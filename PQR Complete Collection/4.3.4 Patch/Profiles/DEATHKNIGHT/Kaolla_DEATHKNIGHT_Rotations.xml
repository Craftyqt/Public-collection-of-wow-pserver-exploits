There are essentially two specs (with minor variations) for Unholy, both of which are covered in this profile. Both are viable at all levels of play. The sole difference is whether you use your Unholy and Death Runes for Necrotic Strike (absorbs heals) or Scourge Strike (straight damage). This will depend entirely on your comp and personal preference.

Necrotic Strike - (3/7/31)
http://www.wowhead.com/talent#j0hZG0ooZfMcdcfzRku:sVcV0czmc

If you arena with a comp such as PHD, with a partner that can unload significant burst damage (such as a Hunter), you may find that the sheer pressure of Necrotic Strike is more important than the extra damage from Scourge Strike. Your ability to kill in duels and BGs, however, is lessened.

This profile will eventually send certain notification events to Diesall&amp;apos;s PQInterface addon. It&amp;apos;s an exceptional addon, and it looks great. Get it!

I advise setting your pet to Defensive, and to practice using your Ghoul! This profile includes comprehensive Pet Handling functions; it will always maintain enough energy to Gnaw/Monstrous Blow as long as that spell is off-cooldown, and otherwise handle the use of Claw perfectly.

As a result, you&amp;apos;ll be able to stun your target on a moment&amp;apos;s notice. Pet Healing, as well as fast Shadow Infusions, are also handled by this rotation.

Note that, unlike in my previous profile, your Ghoul will stick to its target like glue. It will sit on whatever you tell it to attack, so take advantage of this and be mindful of what it&amp;apos;s doing.


This profile uses the following modifier keys:

Left Shift - Pause
Left Alt - Death Grip
Left Control - Strangulate (Target)
Right Control - Chains of Ice (Mouseover)

Bind the macros I included in my post on OwnedCore.

I also use the following keybinds:

Shift+Mouse Wheel Up - Pet Attack Mouseover Macro
Shift+Mouse Wheel Down - Pet Follow
Shift+Mouse Wheel Click - Pet Move To
E - Lichborne
Shift+E - Unholy Frenzy
R - Gnaw Mouseover Macro (pet)
Shift+R - Strangulate (Focus)
C - Icebound Fortitude
Shift+C - Anti-Magic Zone
F - PvP Trinket/Every Man for Himself
Shift+F - Death and Decay
Q - Leap/Shambling Rush (pet)
1 - Focus (Mouseover) Macro
2 - Dark Simulacrum
3 - Empower Rune Weapon
4 - Anti-Magic Shell

While PQR will summon your Gargoyle automatically, it will not use Unholy Frenzy. I made this decision because Unholy Frenzy can be used to break CCs on yourself or friendly players, or even cast on your Ghoul, and therefore it&amp;apos;s up to you to make the right decision.

While Lichborne is activated, PQR will actively attempt to heal you if your health is below 60%. It will also automatically sacrifice your Ghoul and Death Strike if your health falls below 35%.

Above all else, practice. Unholy is a difficult playstyle, even with PQR doing 90% of the work. Just be thankful that this program saves you from learning another 50 keybinds.

Scourge Strike - (0/7/34)

If you do 3&amp;apos;s with a Warlock (as I do), or a similar DoT class, you may find this Scourge Strike build to be more useful. In 2&amp;apos;s and BGs, this is likely the stronger build, as it delivers significantly more actual damage to the target, while still proccing the area control of Desecration. Still, your mileage may vary.

Even with this build, I often use Necrotic Strike against certain healers, especially Discipline Priests and Restoration Druids. It will also attempt to apply the debuff if your health falls below a certain percentage versus a caster, as a defensive ability. If you don&amp;apos;t like this behavior, simply remove Necrotic Strike from the Current Ability list.

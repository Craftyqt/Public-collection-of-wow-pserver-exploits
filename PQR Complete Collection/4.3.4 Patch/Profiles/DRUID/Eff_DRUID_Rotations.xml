-- Hotkeys
Hold down LEFT SHIFT for Tree of Life
Hold down LEFT CONTROL for Tranquility
Hold down RIGHT ALT to allow Lifebloom to fall off
Hold down RIGHT CONTROL to add/remove someone from the healing blacklist

-- Usage
Lifebloom will be cast on your current focus target, which can by easily changed with the macro command /tankswitch or automatically based on your current (enemy) targets highest threat tank.
The rotation uses the custom targeting built into PQR to heal without targeting them; however if you target or hover over a unit they will be healed instead of the automatically chosen target.
Regrowth will be cast whenever Clearcast procs, Nature&amp;apos;s Grace is off CD or a target is &amp;lt; 35% HP.
Healing Touch will cast Nature&amp;apos;s Swiftness when a target is &amp;lt; 35% and is used normally on targets under 55%.
Other than that Wild Growth will be used when it&amp;apos;s off CD, Swiftmend only to create Efflourescence, Trinkets used whenever they are off CD, Barkskin used if you get below 65% health and the standard Rejuv and Nourish spam for normal healing.

-- Slash Commands
To make certain actions easily there are a number of slash commands you can macro

- /blclear - This will clear the current healing ignore blacklist
- /decurse - This will toggle automatic decursing on or off
- /tankswitch - This will toggle the focus between the current tanks in the raid (not enabled while in a party)
  
-- Config
Before usage it is recommended to edit the &amp;quot;Functions&amp;quot; ability to alter the following variables

- Debuffs - add any Debuffs you wish to dispell, in the comma-seperated list
- DispellEnhance - set it to false if you do not have Nature&amp;apos;s Cure
- IgnoreTargets - set it to false to disable the ability to blacklist players and refuse them direct healing
- FocusSwitch - set it to false to disable automatic focus switching on your current (enemy) target, disabled when the /tankswitch command is used

As well as being able to customise the slash command names to easily hide them from Blizzard</RotationNotes></Rotation></DRUID>

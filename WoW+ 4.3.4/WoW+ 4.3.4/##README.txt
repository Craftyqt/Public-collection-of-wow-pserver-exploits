This is the default WoW+ folder,
I included an injector for use in a folder in Extras,
	WoW+ Extras\##DLL Injector\AutoInject.exe

1)	Open it up,
2)	click the "..." button under processes and navigate to your wow.exe
3)	Select your exe and press Open
4)	Click the "+" button next to the "..." button
5)	click the "..." button under Libraries and navigate to your plus.dll
6)	Select the dll and press Open
7)	Click the filepath the appeared previously in the Processes box
8)	Click the "+" button next to the "..." button
9)	If you have WoW open, you can press "Inject" and WoW+ should appear ingame

WARNING - 	Do not tick the box "Inject upon process startup" or Inject more than once,
		WoW+ WILL crash your client if that happens.

I have tried to explain this the best way possible by adding ##README.txt files to almost every folder so you
understand, Please have fun, and remember, Hack Responsibly.

The things in this folder are all extas for WoW+
	-DLL Injector
This is an opensource injector that allows you to inject plus.dll into the wow client
	-WoW EXE
This is an EXE for Molten WoW, just in case yours does not work, this is compatiable with every private server
	-batch
This is a collection of files for BatchPort and goes into your Main WoW+ folder (where plus.dll is located)
	-NAssist
This is the HB plugin to enable interaction between HB and WoW+ (paste the folder into your HB Plugins folder)
	-Positions Text Files
These are different text files I have collected, used and built over the years, there will be repetitions,
It is up to you which one you use, just move it into your main WoW+ folder and rename it positions.txt overwriting
your old file
	-scripts
These are different plugins for WoW+ to increase functionality, some of these won't work as I haven't converted them
from 5.0.5 down to 4.3.4, find which ones work, or make them work.
	-Zygor++ Pointer
This file is to enable communication between ZygorGuides and WoW+ using the Zygor++ WoW+ script, move this into your
ZygorGuides addon folder overwriting Pointer.lua

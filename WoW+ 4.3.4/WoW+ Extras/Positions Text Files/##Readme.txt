Each text file has a different size, and therefor different coords, some are from 5.0.5 (MOP)
though you wont see those coords without being on Pandaria (which is impossible in cata)

I have no idea which is the best to use as I changed some of them around personally

It is best to play around with them and see for yourself which is best.

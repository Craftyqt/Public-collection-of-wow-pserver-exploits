 What you do with the macro is, you goto booty bay, Tanaris, or Winterspring, and you spam the macro. it will refresh the last page of the
 AUction House, then what you do is.. wait hoooouuuurrrsssss, and wait, and watch for items that are getting transfered for 1c-200g.. 
Normally thesse items are worth a sickamount of gold

 Ive sniped Black Lotus x20 for 2 Gold, and that sells for 1600g

I practically make 4k gold doing this.

Every day
=====================================


Auction SNIPER

(Ingame - Macro)

/run _,si=GetNumAuctionItems("list")QueryAuctionItems('',nil,nil,0,0,0,math.floor(si/50),false,0,false)



======================================

Click the Time buttton so that it shows the *TIME LEFT*, make it so its Descending, so it shows the lowest timed item on the x-faction AH

Click the macro when the search button turns red - 5 sec CD - , When you see an item pop up.. Basically it shows the items that people are trying to x-fer
x-realm.. You can snipe these Easy.. cause it dosnt registr on the AH pages for atleast 8 sec. so when u see an item. it will pop up, u just ned
need to click Buyout and OK butttons before the person x-fring them can buy tthem out - Chances aree, tthat person has a macroo similar
to this, so theey dont lose thee item to people like me and you. Ive made SOO much gold from this already its not even fair.



Its pretty amazing.

I use a level 6 Rogue ( stealthed Chars are best. Cause u will die. ALOT if ur anything else.) 

and i snipee itmes, sell. get myself a base cashup, make 4k in a fw hours and call it a day. 

Be smart about it.. u wont regret anything

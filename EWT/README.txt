=> FOR PLAYERS ON RETAIL - 7.3+
- All opened windows are being monitored while WoW is running. You don't even need to be logged in.
- Don't store EWT in a folder named "EWT", "EasyWoWToolbox" or "WoW Hacks". Rename the folder to something else.
- If you open Windows Explorer, WoW is able to read the window title and may flag your account, even if EWT isn't running.
- Be VERY careful when using other public 3rd party tools since their names could also be flagged.
- Warden can read the running processes and their files.
- NEVER open WoW before EWT. Always launch WoW from EWT so it can properly bypass all the detections listed above.
- NEVER open any of the following applications while WoW is running: Cheat Engine, WinDbg, ArtMoney, x64dbg, ReClass, Struct Builder or Scylla.
- NEVER run multiple EWTs nor multiple WoWs.
- If EWT detects WoW Retail as if it is a Private Server, report to reliasn immediately and don't use EWT!

=> OTHER INFO
- Certain private servers detect EWT even without being injected. Because of that, EWT's executable is named "chrome.exe".
- You can rename "chrome.exe" to anything else, but it's not needed.
- When things break "all of a sudden" and a new EWT hasn't been released, it's usually because some anti-cheat got implemented/changed.

Restricted Names Patch 1.12.1 / 2.4.3 / 3.3.5a
FIXED ON WARMANE.
No way around this unfortunately, serverside fix.


This is a little patch I made, that allows you to bypass the reserved names restrictions when creating a character... With this you'll be able to create characters with names such as God, Satan, Warlock, Human and many others. It also removes the profanity name restriction, and that's pretty self explanatory...

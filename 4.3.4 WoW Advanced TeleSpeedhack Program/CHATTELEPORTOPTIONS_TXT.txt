===============Chat Teleport Guide====================
======================================================
To teleport, there is a begin string and an
end string. The default settings are as follows.
"\g" = Teleport begin string
"\r" = Teleport end string
"\s" = SAVE Waypoint Begin String
"\w" = Save Waypoint End String

For example, if I wanted to teleport to my custom
location named "12", I would type in the following.

\g 12 \r

And it would teleport me to the target location.
The save waypoint works exactly the same way.
If I wanted to save my current position as "Home",
i'd enter the following.

\s home \w

After saving a waypoint, you will hear a sound play
indicating that the waypoint should have been saved.

If I wanted to teleport to my new home waypoint after
saving it, I would simply type in the following line.

\g home \r


Of course, you can change the begin and end strings to
whatever you want, but it is HIGHLY RECCOMENDED to use
characters that you would never normally use together

Examples "\g ][f /xx"

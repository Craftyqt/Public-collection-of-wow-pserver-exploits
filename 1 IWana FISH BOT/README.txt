Thanks for downloading my bot!

Here are some tips if you can't get it to work
1) make sure WoW is running in Windowed mode,
2) make sure all your video settings are at their lowest, this doesn't include 
the resolution

if you do see the lootwindow, but it doesn't actually loot the fish, just turn of
'autoloot' which can be found at the interface options

To create a new profile, just enter a non-existing name, and follow the
instructions (after pressing Start)

Hotkeys:
f9: toggles sound on catch
f10: pause the bot (show the main window)
f11: exit the bot instantly

For safety reasons, it's best to enable random titles (found in profiles.ini after
running the bot), just change the value to 1
Also you should rename the bot to something random.

If you wish to spread this bot (please do =D) please don't modify the source, 
if this does happen, i will never ever release anything again to the public, 
and that wouldn't be nice, not for me and neither for you.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hestitate 
to mail me (ziao.heerst@gmail.com)

Have fun!

btw, try using 'beep' as a profile ;)
